I. THE Proverbs of David's son Solomon, who reigned over Israel, to give a knowledge of wisdom and instruction—the perception of the words of prudence—the interpretation of sentences—a discernment of true justice; and to direct judgment, that he might give sagacity to the innocent; and to the youth knowledge and discretion: for by attending to them a wise man will become wiser; and a man of understanding will possess a rule of government and will understand a proverb and dark speech and the sayings of the wise and parables.

7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. And all who practise this have good understanding. And piety towards God is the beginning of discernment: but the wicked despise wisdom and instruction.

8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father and reject not

9 the maxims of thy mother: for thou wilt receive a graceful crown for thy head; and a chain of gold for thy neck.

10 My son, let not wicked men lead thee astray. Consent not

11 when they advise thee, saying, Come with us; partake of blood; and let us hide in the earth an innocent man without cause,

12 and swallow him up alive, as the grave, and take away from earth the remembrance of him. Let us seize his precious substance and fill our houses with spoils. Cast in thy lot among us, and let us all have a common purse. Let one scrip serve us.

15 Go not thou in the way with them; but turn thy foot from their paths. For nets are not spread for birds unjustly. For they who are accomplices to murder, treasure up evils for themselves. And doleful is the destruction of wicked men. Such are the ways of all who commit iniquitous deeds. For by wickedness they destroy their own soul.

20 Wisdom uttereth her song at the gates and in the streets speaketh boldly; and on the tops of walls she maketh proclamation; and at the gates of mighty men taketh a seat and at the gates of a city with confidence saith,

22 "While the innocent adhere to justice they shall not be put to shame: but as for fools who delight in mischief, having become wicked they hated knowledge and are become liable to censures. Behold I will pour forth to you the dictate of my spirit: and teach you this word of mine—seeing I have called
and you have not answered: and though I continued my speech, you did not attend: but set at naught my counsels and disregarded my reproofs: therefore I will laugh at your calamity; and mock when your destruction cometh. Yes, when tumult shall suddenly come upon you; and destruction like a whirlwind shall be at hand—even when tribulation and siege approach you; or when destruction is advancing upon you.

For when you call upon me I will not listen to you. The wicked may seek me, but they shall not find me. For they hated wisdom and did not chuse the word of the Lord: nor would they attend to my counsels, but contemned my reproofs: Let them eat, therefore, the fruits of their own way; and be filled with their own iniquity. For, because they wronged infants they shall be slain: and a rigorous inquest shall destroy the wicked. But he who hearkeneth to me shall dwell with hope; and rest secure from all evil."

II. My son, if thou wilt receive the dictate which I enjoin and hide it with thee, thine ear will hearken to wisdom; and thou wilt apply thy heart to understanding, and transmit it for instruction to thy son. For if thou wilt call upon wisdom: and utter thy voice for understanding—if thou wilt seek for it as silver; and search for it as for treasures; then thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord; and find the knowledge of God. For the Lord giveth wisdom; and from his presence is knowledge and understanding: and he treasureth up salvation for the upright. He will protect their going, that they may keep the paths of rectitude. And he will guard the way of them who reverence him. Then thou shalt understand judgement and justice; and direct all thy wheels right. For when wisdom entereth into thine understanding: and knowledge appeareth pleasant to thy soul: good counsel will keep thee, and holy prudence will guard thee: that she may deliver thee from an evil way and from a man who speaketh perversely.

Alas for them who leave straight paths to walk in the ways of darkness; who are delighted with evils and have joy in evil perversion; whose ways are crooked, and whose paths turn aside to lead thee far from the straight road and estrange thee from a just determination.

My son, let not evil counsel, who hath forsaken the disci-
pline of youth and hath forgotten the divine covenant, take hold of thee. For she hath placed her house near death; and her wheels with the earth born near the mansion of the dead. None who walk by her direction can ever return; nor ever recover the right paths. For they are not taken hold of by years of life. If they indeed had walked in good ways: they would have found the paths of justice smooth. Because the upright shall inhabit the land; and the holy shall be left in it; the ways of the wicked shall be destroyed from the land; and the transgressors shall be driven out of it.

III. My son, forget not my laws; but let thy heart keep my commandments. For they will add to thee length of days and years of life and peace.

2 Let not acts of kindness and faithfulness forsake thee: but bind them about thy neck and thou shalt find favour. Be provident in regard to things good in the sight of the Lord and of men. Trust in God with thy whole heart; and be not elated for thine own wisdom. Shew it in all thy ways, that it may make thy paths straight. Be not wise in thine own conceit; but fear God and depart from all evil: then shall thy body have health and thy bones a cure. Honour the Lord with some of thy righteous labours: and set apart for him some of thy fruits of righteousness: that thy barns may be plenteously filled with corn; and that thy vats may overflow with wine.

11 My son, slight not the correction of the Lord; nor faint when reproved by him: for whom the Lord loveth he reproveth: and chastiseth every son whom he receiveth.

13 Happy the man, who hath found wisdom: and the mortal who hath seen prudence: for it is better to traffick for her, than for treasures of gold and silver. She is more precious than costly stones: and nothing evil can be compared to her. She is easily known by all who approach her; but no price is equal to her in value. For length of days and years of life are in her right hand; and in her left, riches and glory. Out of her mouth proceedeth righteousness: and on her tongue she carrieth law and mercy. Her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to all who take hold of her; and safe for them who rely on her, as on the Lord.

19 By wisdom God founded the earth; and by understanding he
20 furnished the heavens. By knowledge the deeps were broken up and the clouds distilled dew.

21 My son, be not wanting in retention: but keep my counsel,
22 namely, the sentiment: that thy soul may live and that grace may be around thy neck: and it will be health to thy flesh and
23 a cure for thy bones; that thou mayst proceed on in all thy ways in peace and security; and that thy foot may not stumble.
24 For when thou liest down, thou shalt be free from fear: and
25 when thou sleepest, thou shalt sleep sweetly; and shalt not fear the bursting in of terror; nor the sudden assaults of wicked men. For the Lord will be over all thy ways, and will support thy foot that thou mayst not be shaken.

27 Delay not to do good to the needy, when it is in the power
28 of thy hand to help. Do not say, Go away and come again: to-morrow I will give; when thou hast it in thy power to do good: for thou knowest not what to-morrow will bring forth.

29 Devise not evils against thy friend; who sojourneth with thee and confideth in thee.

30 Be not at enmity with a man without cause; lest he do thee some mischief.

31 Acquire not the reproaches of bad men, nor be fond of
32 their ways. For every transgressor is impure in the sight of the Lord: and among the righteous he taketh not a seat.

33 The curse of God is in the houses of the wicked: but the
34 folds of the righteous are blessed. The Lord resisteth the proud;
35 but he granteth favour to the humble. The wise shall inherit glory; but the wicked have extolled dishonour.

IV. Hear, O children, the instructions of a father; and attend
2 to know the meaning: for I am giving you a good gift; forsake
3 not my law: for I was a son obedient to a father; and beloved
4 in the sight of a mother: and they said when they taught me,
    "Let our words sink deep in thy heart. Keep our com-
5 mandments; do not forget—overlook not the dictate of my
6 mouth: forsake it not, and it will defend thee: love it and it
8 will preserve thee: secure it and it will exalt thee: honour it
9 that it may embrace thee: that it may be to thy head a crown
of graces and cover thee with a crown of pleasure."

10 Hear my son and receive my words; that, when the years of thy life shall be multiplied, thou mayst have many ways of
11 a livelihood: for I am teaching thee ways of wisdom; and
12 confirming thee in right paths. For when thou goest, thy steps
will not be straitened: and when thou runnest thou shalt not
13 be tired. Take fast hold of mine instruction, let it not go: but
14 keep it for thyself during thy life. Go not in the ways of wick-
15 ed men; nor be fond of the ways of transgressors. In what
place soever they encamp, go not thither: but turn away from
16 them and keep at a distance: for they cannot sleep. Unless
they do evil; their sleep is taken from them and they cannot
17 lie down to rest. For they eat the bread of wickedness; and
drink plentifully of the wine of violence. But the paths of the
just shine like light; shining more and more until it is perfect
19 day. But the ways of the wicked being dark; they know not
at what they stumble.
20 Attend, my son, to my speech, and incline thine ear to my
21 words. That thy fountains may not fail thee, keep them in thy
22 heart; for they are life to them who find them and health to all
23 flesh. Guard thy heart with all diligence; for out of these are
24 the issues of life. Put away from thee a froward mouth, and
25 put perverse lips far from thee. Let thine eyes look straight
26 forward and thine eyelids wink justly. Make straight paths
27 with thy feet and order all thy ways right. Turn not to the
right, nor the left; but turn away thy foot from an evil way;
for God knoweth the ways on the right, but those on the left
are crooked. But he will make thy paths straight and conduct
thy steps in peace.

V. My son, attend to my wisdom, and incline thine ear to my
2 words, that thou mayst keep a good understanding. Now the
sense of my lips giveth thee this injunction—listen not to an
3 abandoned woman; for honey droppeth from the lips of a har-
4 lot, which for a while pleaseth thy palate; but in the end thou
wilt find it bitterer than gall, and sharper than a two edged
5 sword. For the feet of folly lead them, who indulge themselves
6 with her, down with death to the mansion of the dead. Her
steps indeed are not established, for she walketh not in the
7 ways of life. Her paths are slippery and not easily known. Now
8 therefore, my son, hearken to me and slight not my words. Re-
move thy way far from her, go not near the doors of her house;
9 That thou mayst not give thy life to others, and thy substance
10 to the cruel: that strangers may not be filled with thy wealth,
11 and thy labours go into the houses of strangers, and thou at last be grieved. When the flesh of thy body is consumed, then
12 thou wilt say, "How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof! I hearkened not to the voice of him who instructed me and taught me; nor have I inclined mine ear. I have been almost in all evil, in the midst of the assembly and congregation."
15 Drink water from thine own vessels, and from the wells of thine own fountain. Let not the waters from thy fountain over-flow for thee; but let thy waters run in thine own streets. Let them be for thyself only, and let no stranger partake with thee. Let thy fountain of water be appropriate to thyself; and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. Let thy loving hind and graceful fawn converse with thee; and let her be accounted peculiarly thine, and be with thee on all occasions. For ravished with her love thou wilt become a numerous family. Be not devoted to a strange woman, nor embraced in the arms of one not thine own.
21 For the ways of a husband are before the eyes of God, and he examineth narrowly all his paths. Iniquities hunt a man; but every one is caught by the cords of his own sins. Such a one dieth with the uninstructed, but from his plentiful means of living he was cast out, and perished by reason of folly.

VI.
1 My son, if thou become surety for thy friend, thou wilt deliver up thy hand to an enemy. For a man's own lips are a powerful snare, and he is caught by the words of his own mouth.
3 Do, my son, what I enjoin thee, and save thyself; for thou art come into the hands of bad men on thy friend's account. Be not remiss, but importune thy friend for whom thou art surety.
4 Give no sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids, that thou mayst be saved like a roe from a toil, and like a bird from a snare.
6 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; and having seen its ways follow the example and be wiser than it. For having no cultivated field, no driver, nor master, it provideth its food in summer, and layeth up a plentiful supply in harvest. Or go to the bee and learn what a worker she is: and how seriously she performeth her work, to the labours of which both kings and subjects apply themselves as far as health permits; and to all it is
agreeable and honourable. And though her strength be small, having honoured wisdom she is diligently employed. How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard, and when wilt thou rouse from sleep? Thou art sleeping a little—but resting a little—but taking a short nap—but folding thy hands a little while on thy breast! But is not poverty coming upon thee like an unwelcome traveller? And want like a speedy courier? Whereas if thou be diligent; thy harvest will come like a fountain, and want like a bad courier will run away.

A man void of understanding, and a transgressor, walketh in ways which are not good. But he winketh with his eye and maketh a sign with his foot; and teacheth, by pointing his fingers; his depraved heart contriveth mischief. Such a one is continually raising tumults in a city. For this cause his destruction cometh suddenly—wounds and incurable bruises. Because he delighteth in all those things which God hateth: therefore he is destroyed for the depravity of his soul. His eye is that of a scorner; his tongue is false; his hands are employed in shedding innocent blood—his heart contriveth wicked purposes, and his feet are swift to do evil: as a false witness he spreadeth lies, and soweth discord among brethren.

My son, keep the laws of thy father, and reject not the maxims of thy mother. Bind them continually on thy mind: and tie them as a chain around thy neck. When thou walkest, take this along and let it be with thee: and when thou sleepest, let it guard thee; that when thou awakest, it may talk with thee. For the command of a law is a lamp and light; and reproof and instruction is the way of life, to keep thee from a married man, and from the flattering tongue of a strange woman. Let not a lust for beauty overcome thee: be not captivated by thine eyes, nor ensnared by her eyelids. For the price of a harlot is scarce that of a single loaf; but an adulteress hunteth for the precious lives of men. Can any one put fire in his bosom and not burn his clothes? Or can one walk on coals of fire and not burn his feet? So he who goeth in, to a married woman, cannot escape punishment—no, nor any one who toucheth her. It exciteth no wonder, if one be caught stealing; for a hungry man stealeth to satisfy his soul; but if he be caught, he is to pay seven fold; and by giving all that he hath, he will deliver
32 himself. But he, who through want of understanding, commit-
33 teth adultery, provideth destruction for his soul. He suffereth
pangs and dishonour; and his reproach can never be wiped
34 away. For the rage of her husband being full of jealousy, will
35 not spare in the day of vengeance; nor will he abate his enmi-
ty for any ransom; nor be appeased by many gifts.

VII. My son keep my words and lay up my commandments
with thee.

2 My son, honor the Lord and thou shall be strong; but be-
sides him, fear no other. Keep my commandments, that thou
3 mayst live; and my words as the apple of thine eye. Bind them
about thy fingers, and write them on the table of thy heart.
4 Implore Wisdom to be thy sister, and make Understanding
5 thine acquaintance: that she may keep thee from a strange and
wicked woman, in case she, with alluring words should attack
6 thee. For through a lattice she looketh out of her house into
7 the streets; and if among the simple youths she chanceth to
8 see a young man, void of understanding, walking near a corner
9 in the passages to her house, and talking in the twilight, when
10 the evening is still and duskish: —then this woman, who mak-
eth the hearts of young men flutter, meeteth him, in the attire
11 of a harlot. Indeed she is ever on the wing and insatiable, and
12 her feet abide not at home. For sometimes she roveth abroad:
and sometimes lieth in wait in the streets, at every corner.
13 Ha! she hath caught him and kissed him, and with an unblush-
ing countenance, said to him:
14 "I have a peace offering; to-day I am paying my vows:
15 for this reason I came out to meet thee: earnestly longing to
16 see thee. I have found thee. With cords I have stretched my
17 bed, and decked it with tapestry from Egypt. I have perfum-
18 ed my bed with saffron, and my house with cinnamon: come,
and let us take our fill of love till the morning:—come and let
19 us solace ourselves with love. For my husband is not at home,
20 he is gone a long journey; he took in his hand a roll of silver,
and will return to his house after many days."
21 So with much fawning discourse she led him astray; and
22 with the flattery of her lips inveigled him. And he is gone
after her, attracted by her; as an ox is led to slaughter, or as
a dog to be chained: or like a deer pierced through the liver
23 with a dart. And he hasteth like a bird to a snare; not knowing that he is running the risk of his life.

24 Now therefore my son hearken to me; and attend to the words of my mouth. Let not thy heart turn aside to her ways:

25 for she hath wounded and brought down many; and innumerable are they whom she hath slain. Her house is the highway VIII. to Hades, leading down to the chambers of death. As for thee thou art to proclaim wisdom; that understanding may attend thee. For she is on the lofty summits; and hath taken her stand in the middle of highways. For at the gates of the mighty she hath taken a seat, and at the entrance thereof chanteth her song.

4 "To you, O men, I call, and utter my voice to the sons of men. Ye who are innocent learn discretion: and ye who are uninstructed give attention. Hearken to me, for I will speak solemn things; and with my lips disclose things which are right. For my mouth shall speak truth; lying lips are indeed abominable in my sight. All the words of my mouth are with righteousness; they have nothing crooked—nothing deceitful in them. They are all plain to men of understanding: and right to them who find knowledge. Receive instruction in preference to silver, and knowledge rather than fine gold.—For wisdom is better than precious stones: and no costly thing is equal to it in value. I wisdom have inhabited counsel and knowledge; and I have made an appeal to understanding. The fear of the Lord hateth injustice and insolence and haughtiness and the ways of the wicked: and I have hated the crooked ways of bad men. To me belong counsel and safety. Prudence is mine—mine is fortitude. By me kings reign and princes decree justice. By me potentates are exalted; and by me sovereigns rule the earth. Them who love me, I love: and they who seek me shall find me. With me are riches and glory; even great possessions and righteousness. My fruit is better than gold and precious stones: and my productions are better than choice silver. I walk in the ways of righteousness; and am conversant in the paths of judgment: that I may distribute wealth to them who love me; and fill their treasuries with good things.
Having told you things which happen daily; I will now remember to reckon up things of old. The Lord created me, the beginning of his ways for his works. Before this age he founded me; in the beginning; before he made the earth and before he made the deeps: before the fountains of water issued forth—before the mountains were established; and before all the hills, he bringeth me forth. The Lord made fields and uninhabited wilds; and the habitable heights of the earth. When he furnished the heaven, I was with him; and when he set apart his own throne on the winds: and when he strengthened the clouds above: and when he secured the fountains of the earth below—And when he made the foundations of the earth strong: I was harmonizing with him. I was the one in whom he delighted; and I was daily gladdened by his presence on all occasions—when he finished the world and was pleased therewith; and when he was pleased with the sons of men. Now therefore, my son hearken to me: happy is the man who will hearken to me: and the man who will keep my ways; watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. For my ways are the ways of life; and volition is obtained from the Lord. But they who sin against me act wickedly against their own souls; and they who hate me love death."

IX. Wisdom hath built herself a house, and fixed underneath it seven pillars. She hath slain her victims. She hath mixed her wine for the cup and furnished her table. She hath sent out her servants, and with a loud proclamation hath given an invitation to her entertainment, saying,

"Whosoever is simple, let him come to me." And to them who want understanding she saith, "Come, eat of my bread and drink the wine which I have mixed for you. Forsake folly, that you may reign forever: and seek prudence and build up understanding with knowledge." He who instructeth the wicked shall receive for himself dishonour; and he who reproveth the ungodly will blemish himself. Rebuke not the wicked, lest they hate thee; rebuke a wise man and he will love thee. Give a wise man a hint and he will be wiser—an intimation to a righteous man and he will proceed to take it. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and knowledge is the counsel of the holy. For to know the law is a characteristic of a
good understanding; for by this means thou shalt live long, and years of life will be added to thee.

12 My son, if thou art wise for thyself, thou wilt be wise also for thy neighbours. But if thou become wicked, thou alone shalt draw up evils. He who leaneth upon lies, feedeth on the wind, and he shall pursue flying birds; for he hath left the walks of his own vineyard, and wandered out of the paths of his own field, and traverseth a desert without water, and a land destined to thirst; and with his hands gathereth sterility. A woman who is foolish and bold needeth a curb; she hath no sense of shame.

13 She sat at the doors of her house—on a seat open to view in the streets; calling to passengers who were going right on their ways, "Let him who is the simplest of you turn aside to me; and them who want prudence I exhort saying, Taste sweetly bread in secret and water sweeter for being stolen. He indeed did not know that with her the earth born perish—that he is lighting upon the perch of death. But fly thou away speedily; tarry not in that place, nor fix thine eyes upon her; for in this manner thou shouldst pass by strange water. Abstain from strange water, and drink not of a strange fountain; that thou mayst live long, and that years of life may be added to thee.

X. A wise son maketh a father glad; but a foolish son is a grief to the mother.

2 Treasures cannot profit the wicked; but righteousness will deliver from death.

3 The Lord will not kill with hunger a righteous soul; but he will overthrow the life of the wicked.

4 Want humbleth a man; but the hands of the diligent enrich.

A well instructed son will be wise, and shall have the simple for a servant.

5 A prudent son is safe from heat; but a transgressing son is blasted in harvest.

6 The blessing of the Lord is on the head of the righteous; but untimely grief shall stop the mouth of the wicked.

7 The just are remembered with praises; but the name of the wicked is extinguished.

8 The wise in heart will receive commandments; but a prevaricating babbler shall be subverted.
9 He who walketh uprightly walketh securely; but he who perverteth his ways shall be known.
10 He who winketh deceitfully with his eyes, collecteth sorrows for men; but he who reproveth freely maketh peace.
11 There is a fountain of life in the hand of the righteous; but destruction will stop the mouth of the wicked.
12 Hatred stirreth up contention; but friendship covereth all them who are not contentious.
13 He who from his lips uttereth wisdom, smiteth an imprudent man with a rod.
14 Wise men will lay up knowledge; but the mouth of the rash is near destruction.
15 The wealth of the rich is a strong city; but penury is the destruction of the wicked.
16 The works of the righteous produce life; but the hands of the wicked produce sins.
17 Instruction keepeth the just ways of life; but unexamined instruction leadeth astray.
18 Honest lips hide hatred; but they who utter reproaches are the greatest fools.
19 In speaking much thou canst not avoid sin; but if thou art sparing of thy lips, thou wilt be wise.
20 The tongue of the righteous is tried silver; but the heart of the wicked will not stand the test.
21 The lips of the righteous are skilled in things lofty; but those devoid of understanding die of want.
22 The blessing of the Lord is on the head of the righteous; it maketh rich, and to it no sorrow of heart shall be joined.
23 A fool doth mischief in sport; but for man wisdom bringeth forth prudence.
24 A wicked man is whirled about by destruction; but the desire of the righteous is acceptable.
25 In a passing tempest a wicked man vanisheth; but the righteous turn aside and are safe forever.
26 As vinegar is hurtful to the teeth; and smoke to the eyes; so is transgression to them who commit it.
27 The fear of the Lord prolongeth days; but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
28  Joy maketh a long abode with the righteous; but the hope of the wicked shall perish.
29  The fear of the Lord is the holy man's bulwark; but destruction is for the workers of iniquity.
30  The righteous shall never transfer; but the wicked shall not inhabit the land.
31  The mouth of the righteous distilleth wisdom; but the tongue of the wicked shall be destroyed.
32  The lips of righteous men distil graces; but the mouth of the wicked is perverse.

XI.
A deceitful balance is an abomination to the Lord: but a just weight is his delight.
2  Where pride entereth, there dishonour [entereth] also.
    But the mouth of the lowly speaketh wisdom.
3  A righteous man dying left sorrow behind him: but the destruction of the wicked cometh suddenly and giveth joy.
5  Righteousness maketh spotless ways straight: but wickedness falleth by iniquity.
6  The righteousness of upright men delivereth them: but transgressors are caught by their destruction.
7  When a righteous man dieth, hope is not lost: but the boast of the wicked perisheth.
8  A righteous man escapeth a snare: and in his stead the wicked is delivered up.
9  In the mouth of the wicked is a snare for citizens: but the knowledge of the righteous conduceth to prosperity.
11  By the good acts of the just a city flourished: but by the mouth of the wicked it was overthrown.
12  A man void of wisdom derideth fellow citizens: but a prudent man enjoyeth quiet.
13  A double tongued man revealeth cabinet counsels: but one of a faithful spirit concealeth matters.
14  They, who have no government, fall like leaves: but in much counsel there is safety.
15  A wicked man doth hurt, when he associateth with the just: but he hateth the sound of safety.
16  A virtuous woman raiseth honour for her husband: but a woman who hateth righteousness is a throne of disgrace.
    The slothful though rich, become indigent: but the diligent are supported with wealth.
17 A merciful man doth good to his own soul: but the merciless destroyeth his own body.
18 A wicked man doth works of injustice: but the seed of the righteous is a reward of truth.
19 A righteous son is born to live; but the pursuit of the wicked tendeth to death.
20 Crooked ways are an abomination to the Lord: but all who are blameless in their ways are his delight.
21 He who wickedly joineth hand to hand shall not go unpunished: but he who soweth righteousness shall receive a just reward.
22 As a jewel in the snout of a swine; so is beauty in a woman void of discretion.
23 The desire of the righteous is altogether good; but the hope of the wicked shall perish.
24 There are some who scattering their substance make it more: and some who gather and make it less.
25 A soul is blessed which is altogether sincere: but a passionate man is not respected.
26 May he who withholdeth corn leave it to the nations! But blessing be on the head of him who distributeth!
27 The contriver of good things seeketh favour: but him, who seeketh mischief, mischief shall overtake.
28 He who trusteth in riches shall fall; but he who helpeth the righteous shall flourish.

26 To fine a righteous man is not good: nor is it consistent with piety to plot against righteous rulers.

27 He who forbeareth to utter a harsh word is prudent: and he who is slow to anger is a man of understanding.

13 A foolish son is a shame to a father.
    Vows for the hire of a harlot are not pure.

will go out with him: for if he sitteth in council he dishonour-eth all.

11 The Lord loveth holy hearts; and all the unspotted are acceptable to him.
    A king feedeth with his lips; but the eyes of the Lord diligently watch the sentiment: and a transgressing word setteth it at naught.

13 A slothful man maketh excuse and saith, There is a lion in the highways and murderers in the streets.

14 The mouth of a transgressor is a deep ditch; and he who is hated of the Lord shall fall into it.
    There are bad ways before a man and he loveth not to avoid them: but he ought to avoid a crooked and bad way.

15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child: but a rod and instruction will drive it from him.

16 Some plunder the poor to increase their wealth and give to the rich to lessen it.

17 Incline thine ear to the words of the wise; and hear my discourse and apply thy heart; that thou mayst know that they are good. If thou indeed wilt lay them up in thy heart; they will give thee delight and be on thy lips. In order that thy hope may be upon the Lord; and that he may make known to thee thy way. Write thou them for thyself three times over; for counsel and knowledge, on the table of thy heart. For this purpose I teach thee sound doctrine and knowledge good to be listened to: that thou mayst answer them who propound to thee words of truth.

22 Oppress not the needy because he is poor: nor treat with disrespect at the gates one who is weak.

23 For the Lord will judge his cause; and thou shouldst preserve thy life safe and secure.

24 Have no fellowship with a man addicted to wrath; nor lodge with a friend who is passionate: lest thou learn his ways and lay a snare for thine own life.

25 Do not out of respect for a person become surety. For if thou hast not wherewithal to pay, thy bed will be taken from under thee.

27 Remove not ancient boundaries which thy fathers have set.
28 A man clear in his perceptions and quick in the despatch of business should stand before kings and not wait on slothful men.

XXIII. When thou sittest down to eat at the table of a ruler; observe diligently what are set before thee; and put to thy hand, knowing that thou must provide the like. But if thou hast an appetite not easily satisfied; desire not his dainties; for they give false life.

3 If thou art poor, enter not into competition with one who is rich: but be restrained by thine own prudence. If thou fix thy view toward him, he is out of sight: for he is provided with wings as of an eagle; and directeth his course to the house of one who is before him.

5 Eat not with an envious man, nor desire his meats: for he eateth and drinketh as one swallowing a hair. Neither invite him to thy house, nor eat thy morsel with him: for it will cause him to vomit and he will blame thy kind invitations.

7 Make no addresses to a man void of understanding: lest he peradventure mock thy judicious discourse. Remove not ancient land marks, nor encroach upon the possession of the fatherless. For the Lord who is their redeemer is strong; and will plead their cause with thee.

10 Apply thy heart to instruction; and prepare thine ears for the words of knowledge.

11 Refrain not from correcting a child: for if thou beat him with a rod, thou mayst prevent his death. For thou wilt beat him with a rod and deliver his soul from death.

13 My son, if thy heart be wise, thou wilt gladden my heart.

14 And thy lips, if they be right, will hold long conversation with mine.

15 Let not thy heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long.

18 If thou indeed keep these instructions: they will be a progeny to thee and thy hope shall not perish.

19 Hear, my son and be wise and direct the thoughts of thy heart aright.

20 Be not a wine bibber, nor devoted to clubs: and to the pursuing of flesh meat. For every one addicted to revelling and
stews shall come to beggary: and every one given to sleep shall be clothed with rags and tatters.

22 Hearken, my son, to the father who begot thee: and despise not thy mother because she is old.

24 A righteous father nourisheth thee well; and his soul rejoiceth in a wise son.

25 Let thy father and thy mother have joy in thee: and let her who bare thee rejoice.

26 My son, give me thy heart; and let thine eyes observe my ways.

27 For a strange house is a hogshead full of holes: and a strange well is narrow. For that will quickly perish; and every transgressor shall be destroyed.

29 Who hath woes? Who hath trouble? Who hath law suits? Who hath vexations and squabbles? Who hath wounds without cause? Whose are the eyes suffused with blood? Are they not theirs who tarry long at wine—who frequent the places where there are revels?

Be not drunk with wine; but converse with righteous men:

31 and converse in the publick walks. For if thou givest thine eyes to cups and goblets; thou wilt go about afterwards na-

32 ked as a pestle: and be, at last, like one swoln by the bite of a serpent; or as one stung by a basilisk. When thine eyes behold a strange woman; then will thy mouth speak perversely.

34 And thou wilt lie as in the midst of the sea: and like a pilot in a mighty storm. And thou wilt say, They have beaten me and I felt no pain; they insulted me and I was not sensible of it. When will it be day, that I may go and seek with whom I can have a meeting.

XXIV. My son, envy not bad men, nor desire to be with them: for their hearts study falsehood; and their lips utter mischief.

3 By wisdom a house is built; and by understanding it is established.

4 By knowledge chambers are filled with all precious and pleasant riches.

5 Better is a wise man than one who is strong: and the man who hath understanding, than he who hath a large cultivated field.
6 By government war is conducted! and help is the attendant of a heart instructed by counsel.

7 Wisdom and good understanding are in the gates of the wise: the wise turn not away from the commandment of the Lord: but they consult in counsels.

9 Death meeteth the uninstructed and a fool dieth by sins.

10 In a man who is selfwilled, arrogant and boastful there is impurity: in an evil day and a day of adversity, he will be stained deeper and deeper, until he utterly faint.

11 Deliver them who are to be led away to death; and inter-

12 cede for them who are to be slain, make no delay. If thou should say, I do not know this man: know that the Lord knoweth the hearts of all: and that he, who gave breath to all, knoweth all things: and will render to every one according to his works.

13 My son, eat honey (for a honey comb is good) that thy pa-

14 late may be sweetened. In like manner let thy soul taste wisdom; for if thou find it, thy end will be good and hope will not forsake thee.

15 Lead not the wicked to the pasture of the righteous; nor

16 be led astray for a bellyfull. For a righteous man may fall seven times and rise again; but in calamities the wicked shall be without strength.

17 If thine enemy fall rejoice not over him; nor be elated at his stumbling: for the Lord will see and it will displease him, and he will turn away his wrath.

18 Rejoice not over evil doers nor envy sinners. For the posterity of an evil one cannot continue; and the lamp of the wicked shall be extinguished.

19 My son, fear God and the king and be not disobedient to either of them. For they can suddenly punish the wicked; and their punishments who can know?

21 A son who keepeth the word shall be far from destruction; for he hath received it to effect.

22 Let no falsehood be uttered from the mouth of a king, and from his mouth let no falsehood proceed.

23 The tongue of a king is a sword and not flesh; whoever is delivered up to it shall be destroyed. For if his wrath be sharpened, it consumeth men with thongs, and devoureth the
bones of men; or like a flame, burneth them up, so that they cannot be devoured by young eagles.

XXX. My son, be awed by these words of mine, receive them and reform. Thus saith the man to them who trust in God—but I stop. For I am the most foolish of all men. And I have not the understanding of man in me. God hath taught me wisdom: and I have gained a knowledge of holy things.

Who hath ascended up to heaven and come down?
Who hath collected the winds in his bosom?
Who hath infolded the water in a mantle?
Who hath a dominion over all the ends of the earth?
What is his name? or what the name of his sons?
Since all the words of God are tried, and he is a shield to them who revere him; add not to his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar.

Two things I beg of thee—deprive me not of favour before I die; remove far from me vanity and lying. Give me neither riches nor poverty, but order for me things necessary and convenient; that when I am filled I may not become false and say, Who seeth me? Or being in want, steal and swear by the name of God.

Deliver not up a servant into the hands of a master; lest he curse thee and thou be removed out of sight.

A wicked progeny curse their father and bless not their mother.

A wicked progeny judge themselves righteous, but have not purged their ways.

A wicked progeny have lofty eyes and uplifted eyebrows.

A wicked progeny have teeth like swords and grinders like cleavers, so as to consume and devour the poor from the earth, and the needy from among men.

XXIV. 23 But this I say to you who are wise to know, it is not good to respect a person in judgment.

He who saith of the wicked, "He is not guilty," shall be cursed by the tribes and hateful to the nations: but they who reprove shall appear better; and upon them a blessing shall come.

Lips will kiss the things which convey good words.

Prepare thy works for the time of going out, and be in com-
plete preparation for the field and come after me; then thou shalt build thyself a house.

28 Be not a false witness against thy fellow citizen, nor give a loose to thy lips. Do not say, "I will use him as he hath used me; and punish him for the injuries he hath done me."

30 A fool is like a field, and a man void of understanding, like a vineyard; if thou lettest them alone, they will be overrun with weeds and grass, and become useless, and their stone fences will be thrown down.

32 I have at length repented and looked about, with a view to chuse instruction. I am dozing a little—just taking a short nap—just infolding my breast with my hands. If such indeed be thy conduct; poverty will come upon thee like a traveller and want like a swift courier.

XXX. 15 The leech had three daughters greatly beloved, but these three did not satisfy her—nay even the fourth did not suffice for her to say, There is enough.

16 The grave, and lust for women, and land unsatiated with water—nay water and fire will never say, There is enough.

17 The eye which derideth a father and despiseth the old age of a mother, may the ravens of the valley pick it out, and the young eagles devour it.

18 There are three things which I cannot perceive, and a fourth which I do not know—the tracks of an eagle in its flying—the footsteps of a serpent on a rock—the marks of a ship crossing the sea—and the ways of a man in youth. Such is the way of an adulterous woman, who having committed the act and washed herself, saith, that she hath done nothing improper.

21 By three things a land is disturbed, and a fourth it cannot bear—a servant when he reigneth—a fool when filled with meat—a handmaid when she expelleth her mistress—and an odious woman when she hath a good husband.

24 There are four things on the earth which are very small, yet they are wiser than the wise—the ants, which not having strength, provide their food in summer—the choirogryllus, which being a feeble nation have built their houses among rocks—the locusts, which having no king encamp regularly at the word of command—and the calabotes, which depending on its feelers and being easily caught maketh its abode in the fortresses of kings.
29 There are three things which march well and a fourth
30 which is stately in its gait—a young lion the strongest of beasts
which turneth not aside nor feareth any beast—and a cock
31 strutting magnanimously among his females—and a he-goat
marching at the head of a flock—and a king harranguing a nation.

32 If thou sufferest thyself to be elated with joy and engagest
in battle thou wilt incur disgrace.

33 Churn milk and there will be butter, and if thou wringest the
nose, blood will issue forth; so if thou usest provoking lan-
guage contentions and quarrels will ensue.

XXXI. These words of mine have been dictated by God,
they are the prophecy of a king whom his mother instructed.

2 What wilt thou keep my son? What! keep the dictates of
God. One right of primogeniture I tell thee, my son. What
is it thou son of my womb? What is it thou son of my vows?

3 Give not thy wealth to women; nor thine understanding and
thy life for that which will bring sorrow.

4 Do all things with counsel. Drink wine with counsel.

5 Princes are passionate, therefore let them not drink wine, lest
by drinking they forget wisdom, and become incapable of ad-
ministering justice to the oppressed.

6 Give strong drink to those in trouble, and wine to be drunk
by them who are in sorrow; that they may forget their distress
and no more remember their troubles.

7 Open thy mouth with the word of God, and administer jus-
tice to all with a sound understanding.

8 Open thy mouth and judge righteously, and plead the cause
of the weak and needy.

XXV. These are the detached instructions of Solomon which
the friends of Hezekias king of Judea copied out.

2 The glory of God obscureth a matter: but the glory of a
king giveth a lustre to actions.

3 Heaven is high and the earth is deep: and the heart of a
king is unsearchable.

4 Beat drossy silver and all that is pure will be purified.

5 Slay the wicked from the presence of a king and his throne
will be established in righteousness.

6 Boast not in the presence of a king; nor range thyself in
the places of princes: For it is better it should be said to thee; "Come up hither;" than that thou shouldst give place at the presence of a prince.

7 Tell what thine eyes have seen.
8 Enter not hastily into a quarrel: lest thou repent at the last when thy friend shall upbraid thee.
9 In yielding shew no contempt, lest thy friend upbraid thee: in which case thy quarrel and enmity will not cease, but last till death.
10 Favour and friendship give freedom. Keep these for thyself that thou mayst not be exposed to reproach. But keep thy ways with a placable temper.
11 It is an apple of gold in a sardine bracelet, thus to speak a word.
12 A precious sardius is bound to an ear-ring of gold; and a word of wisdom to an obedient ear.
13 As the coming out of snow in harvest is grateful according to the degree of heat: so is a faithful messenger to them who send him: for he refresheth the souls of them who employ him.
14 As winds and clouds and rain are conspicuous things; so is he who boasteth for a false gift.
15 By patience kings have a prosperous journey: and a soft tongue breaketh bones.
16 Having found honey eat just what is sufficient: lest being glutted thou vomit it up.
17 Go seldom to the house of thy friend: lest he be cloyed with thee and hate thee.
18 Sharp is a nail and a sword and an arrow: so is a man who beareth false witness against his friend.
19 The way of a bad man and the foot of a transgressor shall be destroyed in an evil day.
20 As vinegar is hurtful to a boil; so bodily disease giveth pain to the heart.
21 As a moth in a garment and a worm in wood: so a man's grief hurteth the heart.
22 If thine enemy hunger feed him; if he be thirsty give him drink: for by doing this thou wilt use the means to melt him; and the Lord will reward thee with good.
23 The north wind raiseth clouds: and an impudent countenance irritateth the tongue.
24 It is better to dwell in a corner of the house top, than with a scolding wife in a wide house.
25 As cold water is grateful to a thirsty soul; so is good news from a distant country.
26 As if one should stop up a fountain and destroy an outlet of water: so is it disorderly for a righteous man to fall before the wicked.
27 It is not good to eat too much honey: but we ought to honour glorious words.
28 A man who doth any thing without counsel; is like a city which hath the foundations of walls laid and is without walls.

XXVI. As dew at the ingathering of fruit and as rain in harvest; so is honour for a fool.
2 As birds and ostriches fly away; so a vain curse will not light on any one.
3 As a whip for a horse and a goad for an ass; so is a scourge for a sinful nation.
4 Answer not a fool conformably to his folly; lest thou be-
5 come like him. But answer a fool according to his folly; that he may not think himself wise.
6 He who sendeth a message by a foolish messenger; by his own ways procureth disgrace.
7 As well take walking from the legs; as transgression from the mouth of fools:
8 He who bindeth a stone in a sling is like him who giveth honour to a fool.
9 Thorns stick in the hands of a drunken man; and slavery in the hand of fools.
10 All the flesh of fools is in a tempest: for their soundest sleep is broken.
11 As a dog becometh odious when he returneth to his vomit; so is a fool for his wickedness, when he returneth to his sin.
12 There is a shame which leadeth to sin: and a shame which procureth glory and honour.
13 I have seen a man who thought himself wise: but there was more hope of a fool than of him.
14 A slothful man sent on a journey saith, There is a lion in the way and murderers in the streets.
15 As a door turneth on its hinges so doth a slothful man on his bed.
16 A slothful man having hid his hand in his bosom cannot bring it out to his mouth.
17 A slothful man thinketh himself wiser than him who in plenty carrieth a message.
    He who meddleth with another's strife, is like one who taketh a dog by the tail.
18 As they who undertake to cure throw out words for men; and he who falleth in with the proposal will be first supplant-
19 ed; so all who ensnare their friends, when they are found out say, I did it in sport.
20 By much fuel a fire is nourished: but where there is no stirrer up of quarrels, contention caseth.
21 A hearth is for coals and fuel for fire: and a contentious man for the bustle of strife.
22 The words of the crafty are soft: but they pierce the inmost recesses of the soul.
23 Silver given with deceit, should be accounted as a potsherd.
    Smooth lips disguise a wicked heart.
24 A weeping enemy assenteth to every thing with his lips: but in his heart he contriveth deceit.
25 Though an enemy intreat thee with a loud voice, believe him not: for in his heart there is seven fold wickedness.
26 He who concealeth enmity practiseth deceit; but being found out he discloseth his sins in publick assemblies.
27 May he who diggeth a pit for his neighbour fall into it; and he who rolleth a stone, roll it on himself.
28 A lying tongue hateth truth; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.

XXVII. Boast not of things of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what the coming day will bring forth.
2 Let a neighbour praise thee and not thine own mouth—a stranger and not thine own lips.
3 A stone is heavy and sand is weighty; but a fool's anger is heavier than both.
4  Wrath is cruel and anger outrageous: but nothing can withstand envy.

5  Open rebukes are better than concealed love.

6  More faithful are the wounds of a friend; than the feigned kisses of an enemy.

7  A full soul loatheth a honey comb: but to a hungry soul even bitter things are sweet.

8  As a bird when taken hooded from its nest; so is a man reduced to slavery, when removed from his country.

9  With myrrh and wine and perfumes the heart is cheered: but with misfortunes the spirit is broken.

10  Thine own friend and thy father's friend forsake not; but when unfortunate go not to the house of thy brother.
    Better is a friend near at hand, than a brother far off.

11  Be wise, my son that thy heart may rejoice, and remove from thee reproachful speeches.

12  When ills approach, a prudent man is hidden: but the simple pass on to their sorrow.

13  Take away his mantle, for a scorner passed by who wasteth the property of others.

14  He who blesseth a friend with a loud voice, rising early, will appear not unlike one who curseth him.

15  A continual dropping driveth a man out of his house in a rainy day: and so doth a contentious wife.

16  Boreas is a harsh wind, though it be called by an honourable name.

17  Iron sharpeneth iron, but a man exasperateth the face of a companion.

18  He who planteth a fig tree shall eat of its fruit; and he who guardeth his master shall be honoured.

19  As faces do not resemble faces: so neither do the thoughts of men.

20  The grave and destruction are never satisfied: in like manner the eyes of men are insatiable.
    He who hath staring eyes, and fools who cannot govern their tongue; are an abomination to the Lord.

21  Fire is the trier of gold and silver: but a man is tried by the mouth of them who praise him.
The heart of a transgressor seeketh evils: but a righteous heart seeketh knowledge.

22 Though thou shouldst whip a fool publickly and disgrace him: thou canst not take away his folly.

23 Be careful to know the state of thy flock; and pay close attention to thy herd: for wealth and power do not continue with a man forever; nor can he transmit them from one generation to another.

24 Take care of the herbage in thy field: mow grass and collect provender from the hills: that thou mayst have sheep for clothing.

25 Honour the field that thou mayst have lambs.

My son, thou hast sayings from me powerfully conducive to thy life: and the life of thy servants.

XXVIII. The wicked fleeth when none pursueth: but the righteous is bold as a lion.

2 Contentions are raised by the sins of the wicked: but a prudent man extinguisheth them.

3 A mighty man by wicked acts oppresseth the poor.
As a sweeping rain is indeed unprofitable, so are they who forsake the law and applaud iniquity: but they who love the law encompass themselves with a wall.

4 Bad men will not understand judgment: but they who seek the Lord will be wise in every thing.

6 Better is a poor man who walketh in truth than a rich liar.

7 A wise son keepeth the law; but he who feedeth prodigality dishonoureth his father.

8 He who increaseth his wealth by usury and unjust gain; gathereth it for him who will pity the poor.

9 As for him who turneth away his ear from hearkening to the law; even his prayer is an abomination.

10 He who causeth the righteous to wander in an evil way shall himself fall into destruction.

The upright shall have good things in possession: but the unrighteous shall pass by good things and shall not enter into them.

A rich man is wise in his own conceit. But a poor man who hath understanding will find him out.
12 For helping the righteous there is great glory: but in the places of the wicked; men are entrapped.

13 He who covereth his wickedness shall not prosper; but he who confesseth and forsaketh will be beloved.

14 Happy the man who piously feareth all things: but he who is of an intractable temper will fall into evils.

15 He who ruleth over a poor nation, himself being poor, is a hungry lion and a ravening wolf.

16 A king straitened in his revenue is a great oppressor: but he who hateth injustice shall live long.

17 He who is bail for a man in a case of murder, shall be a fugitive, but not in safety.

    Correct a son and he will love thee and be an ornament to thy life. He will not hearken to an unrighteous nation.

18 He who walketh righteously will be helped: but he who walketh in crooked ways will be entangled.

19 He who tilleth his own ground shall have plenty of bread; but he who followeth idleness, shall have plenty of poverty.

20 A faithful man will be much praised; but the wicked shall not escape punishment.

21 He who regardeth not the persons of the righteous, is not good: such a one will deliver up a man for a morsel of bread.

22 An envious man hasteth to be rich, and knoweth not that the bountiful shall have mastery over him.

23 He who reproveth a man's ways shall have more thanks than he who hath a flattering tongue.

24 He who casteth off a father or mother and thinketh that he doth not sin; is indeed the partner of an impious man.

25 A faithless man judgeth rashly: but he who trusteth in the Lord will be careful.

26 He who putteth confidence in the boldness of his heart is a fool: but he who walketh wisely shall be saved.

27 He who giveth to the poor shall not be in want: but he who turneth away his eyes shall be indigent.

28 In the places of the wicked, the righteous groan: but by their destruction, the righteous will be multiplied.

XXIX. Better is a man of experience, than a man who is stiff-necked: for when the latter is suddenly burned, there is no healing him.
2 When the righteous are applauded the people will rejoice: but when the wicked bear rule, men will mourn.
3 When a man loveth wisdom his father is gladdened: but he who feedeth harlots spendeth his substance.
4 A righteous king raiseth a country; but a transgressor overthroweth it.
5 He who shall provide a net to catch his friend; spreadeth it for his own feet.
6 For a mighty transgressor there is a great snare; but the just shall have joy and gladness.
7 A righteous man is skilled in administering justice to the poor: but the wicked doth not take due cognisance: nor hath he a feeling heart for the poor.
8 Men regardless of law, set a city in a flame: but wise men avert wrath.
9 A wise man shall judge nations: but a fool when angry is derided and terrifieth not.
10 Men stained with blood hate one who is holy: but the upright will make strict inquest for his life.
11 A fool sheweth all his wrath; but a wise man dispenseth it gradually.
12 When a king hearkeneth to falsehood, all under him are transgressors.
13 When creditor and debtor meet each other; the Lord hath a watch over both.
14 When a king judgeth the poor faithfully; his throne will be established for a memorial.
15 The rod and reproofs give wisdom: but a child led astray shameth his parents.
16 When the wicked abound, transgressions are multiplied: but when they fall, the righteous are awed.
17 Correct thy son and he will give thee rest; and add honour to thy life.
18 With a sinful nation an instructor can not continue: but he who keepeth the law is most happy.
19 A stubborn servant will not be instructed by words: for though he may understand he will not obey.
20 If thou seest a man hasty in his words: be assured there is more hope of a fool than of him.
21 He who feedeth delicately from his youth, shall be a servant and at last afflicted with sorrow.
22 A passionate man stirreth up strife: but a furious man is a digger up of sin.
23 A man's pride will bring him low: but the Lord will gloriously support the humble.
24 He who is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: and so do they, who hear an oath administered, if they do not make discovery.
25 They who fear and reverence men have been supplanted: but he whose trust is in the Lord shall be gladdened.
    Impiety causeth a man to fall: but he who trusteth in the Lord shall be safe.
26 Many court the favour of princes: but justice cometh to a man from the Lord.
27 A righteous man is an abomination to an unjust man: and a straight course is an abomination to a transgressor.

XXXI. 10 Who can find a virtuous woman? Such a one is indeed more valuable than precious stones.
11 The heart of her husband trusteth in her: such a one hath no need of spoils: for she laboureth for her husband's good all her life long.
13 Having spun wool and flax she made a useful work with her hands. She was like a merchant vessel which bringeth riches from afar: She arose by night and gave food to her household and work to her maids. Having viewed a field she bought it, and with the fruits of her hands planted the purchase. Having girded herself tight about the waist, she strengthened her arms for work. And finding that it was good to work, her lamp is not extinguished the whole night. Her elbows she extendeth over the spindle; and her hands she keepeth at the distaff. But she opened her hand to the needy; and stretched out her handful to the distressed. Her husband when long abroad is not concerned for those at home: for all with her are well clothed. She made for her husband double garments; and for herself robes of cotton and purple. And her husband is distinguished in the gates; when he sitteth in council with the elders of the land. She made sindons and sold girdles to the Chananites. She opened her mouth sparingly and with propriety; and had
25 her tongue in due subjection. She clothed herself with majesty and excellence, and enjoyed delights in her latter days. The gates of her house were kept close shut; and she eateth not the bread of idleness. She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and maxims of prudence. Her bounty caused her children to honour her; for they were rich, and her husband praised her.

29 Many daughters have possessed wealth, many have acted virtuously: but thou hast surpassed—thou hast excelled all.

30 False are allurements, and vain the beauty of a wife. For a woman of understanding is blessed. Let her therefore praise the fear of the Lord. Give her of the fruits of her hands; and let her husband be praised in the gates.

ECCLESIASTES.

I. The words of the preacher the son of David, king of Israel in Jerusalem.

2 VANITY of vanities, said the preacher. Vanity of vanities. All is vanity.

3 What lasting advantage hath a man by all the labour with which he toilcth under the sun? One generation passeth away and another cometh. But the earth hath continually kept its station.

5 The sun riseth and the sun setteth and cometh round to his place. Rising there he marcheth southward, then wheelcth about to the north. The wind wheeleth in circuits, and in its circuits it returneth. All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not filled. To the place whence the rivers come, thither they return to continue their course. All these considerations are wearisome. Man cannot recount them: nor can the eye be satisfied with seeing; nor the ear filled with hearing.

9 What is that which hath been? The very same which shall be. And what is that which hath been done? The very same which shall be done: for there is nothing entirely new under the sun. Who can speak and say, Behold this is entirely new. It hath been already in the ages past which were before us.

11 There is no remembrance of former things: and of those things which shall happen hereafter, there will be no remembrance among them who shall be born at a remote period.
12 I the preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem; and I
13 applied my heart to seek and make diligent search by wisdom concerning all the things which are done on the earth. Because God hath assigned to the sons of men painful employment, that they may be kept employed, I took a view of all the different sorts of works which are done under the sun.
15 And behold they are all vanity and vexation of spirit. That which is crooked cannot be made straight, nor can wants be numbered.
16 I communed with my heart, saying, Behold I am become great and have made advances in wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. And I have applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge. And my mind hath taken a view of many things—of wisdom and knowledge—of parables and science. I have found by experience that this also is indeed vexation of spirit.

II. Because by much wisdom there is much knowledge; and he who addeth to his knowledge will add to his sorrow; I said in my heart, 'Come now let me try thee with pleasure. Take a view of that considered as a good. But behold this also is vanity. To laughter I said, It is madness; and to mirth, What is this thou art doing?
3 Now I had examined whether my mind could lead my flesh to wine; and my mind had led it with wisdom, retaining a command over pleasure, until I should see of what sort that good is, which the sons of men are to pursue under the sun, all the days of their life. I enlarged my plan of operations. I built me houses. I planted me vineyards. I made me gardens and orchards and planted therein all sorts of fruit trees. I made me pools of water, to water from them my blooming nurseries. I purchased men servants and maid servants; and had servants born in my family. And my stock of herds and flocks was great above all who were before me in Jerusalem. I collected also for myself silver and gold and the choicest treasures of kings and countries. I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men—a butler and the requisites to entertainments. And I was great and surpassed all who had been before me in Jerusalem; and still my wisdom continued with me. And whatever mine eyes desired I with-
held not from them, nor did I restrain my heart from all my pleasure.

Because my heart had been gladdened with all my labour,
11 (now this was my portion from all my labour) therefore I looked back on all the works which my hands had done, and on the labour with which I had toiled to execute them; and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there is no lasting advantage under the sun.

12 Then I looked back to take a view of wisdom and madness and folly. In all the particulars which formed this deliberation (for who is the man equal to a compleat investigation) I saw indeed that there is an advantage in wisdom above folly, like the advantage of light above darkness. The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness. Nevertheless I knew that one event will happen to them all. Therefore I said in my heart, As the same event will happen to me as happeneth to the fool, why have I studied wisdom? Why communed abundantly with my heart? Because even this is vanity—

16 (since out of an abundance the fool speaketh)—because there is no remembrance forever of the wise man more than of the fool (seeing the days are now coming when all shall be forgotten and the wise must die as well as the fool) therefore I hated the whole of this life; because the work which was done under the sun was toilsome to me—because all are vanity and vexation of spirit: and I hated all this labour of mine for which I am toiling under the sun; because I must leave it to a man who is coming after me; and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? Now if he hath power over all my labour for which I have toiled and in which I have displayed wisdom under the sun; surely this is vanity.

20 Then I turned about that my heart might state distinctly in every labour of mine in which I had toiled under the sun—

21 that here is a man whose labour hath been with wisdom and with knowledge, and with ability; and there is a man to whom, though he did not labour for him, he shall give his portion.

22 Surely this is vanity and a great vexation—That such is the case with another man by all his labours and the vexation of his heart with which he toileth under the sun, that all his days are days of sorrow and his employment grief, and even at night his heart hath no rest. Surely this is vanity.
24 (a) Hath not a man something good which he can eat and drink, and which he can point out to his soul as a good by his labour?
25 (b) With respect to that I saw indeed that even this is from the hand of God; for who can eat or who can drink without him? For to the man who is good in his sight he hath given wisdom and knowledge and joy; and to the sinner he hath given the trouble of gathering and heaping up to give to him who is good in the sight of God. So that this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

III. Time is for all things: but there is a particular portion of time for every particular affair under heaven—a time to be born and a time to die—a time to plant and a time to root up what was planted—a time to kill and a time to heal—a time to pull down and a time to build up—a time to weep and a time to laugh—a time to mourn and a time to dance—a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together—a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing—a time to seek and a time to lose—a time to keep and a time to throw away—a time to rend and a time to sew—a time to be silent and a time to speak—a time to love and a time to hate—a time of war and a time of peace. What is the lasting advantage of the agent from the things in which he laboureth? I have taken a collective view of all the business which God hath assigned to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. All the things which he made, considered as a whole, are good in his time. But with regard to all things considered as one whole, to them he hath assigned the whole age; so that no man can find out the work which God hath done from beginning to end. I have found that there is no good in them (I mean in regard to every man who eateth and drinketh, and can see good in all his labour) if there is not a gift of God that he may be made glad and do good in his life. I have found that all the things which God hath made shall continue their age; there is no adding to it nor taking from it; and that God hath acted that they may be awed at his presence. What hath been is now: and what are to be have already been; and God will find out him who is persecuted: and yet I saw under the sun a place of judgment; was the

(a) an objection, (b) the answer.
wicked there? and a place for the just; was the pious there?
17 Then I said in my heart God will judge the whole class of the righteous, and the whole class of the wicked. For there is a time for every thing; and he is there over all the work.
18 I communed with my heart concerning a saying of the sons of men, "That God distinguisheth them." Now in order to shew that they themselves are beasts, that at least which befalleth man, befalleth them; and that which befalleth the beast befalleth man. The same event happeneth to both. As the one dieth, so doth the other. And they have all one breath. What advantage then hath man over the beast? None: for all are vanity. They are all for one place. They were all from dust:
21 and to dust they shall all return. And who hath seen the breath of the sons of men whether it ascendeth upwards; and the breath of the beast, whether it descendeth downwards into the earth? So I saw that there is nothing good in the works of man, but that by which he can be made glad; for that is his portion, for who will bring him to see what will be after him?
IV. Then I turned and took a view of all the different sorts of oppression under the sun; and behold the tear of the oppressed and they have no comforter. Though from the hand of oppressors some have relief; yet others have no comforter. Therefore I praised the whole body of the dead—those who were already dead, above the living—those who are still alive: but better than both is he who hath never been—who hath not seen all the evil work which is done under the sun.
4 In the review of labour in general, I took a view in particular of manly exertion in executing. Because this causeth a man to be envied by his neighbour, this therefore is vanity and vexation of spirit. The fool folded his hands and devouring his flesh said, Better is one handful of rest than two handfuls of labour and vexation of spirit.
7 Then I turned and took a view of a vanity under the sun—
8 Here is a single individual who hath no second; at least he hath neither son nor brother, yet there is no end to all his labour. His eye is not satisfied with riches, yet doth he say, For whom do I labour and deprive my soul of good? Surely this is vanity and a sore vexation. Two are better than one. They have a better reward for their labour. For if they chance to fall the one
can raise up his fellow. But alas for him who is alone, when he falleth and hath not another to raise him up. Again if two lie together they have warmth: but how can one be warm who is alone? Again though one should be strong the two may withstand him, and a three fold cord cannot easily be broken.

Better is a poor and wise subject than an old and foolish king who hath not yet learned how to conduct himself; for out of prison he may come to reign. Because even in his own kingdom he was needy, I took a view of the whole body of the living who were walking under the sun with the youth second in rank who is to succeed him. There is no end of all the people—of all who resorted to them. Yet they who come last will have no joy in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and let thy sacrifice be a readiness to hear rather than the oblation of fools. Because they are not sensible that they do amiss, be thou not rash with thy mouth; nor let thy heart be hasty to utter a word in the presence of God. Because God is in the heaven above, and thou art on the earth, let thy words therefore be few. Because a dream cometh by much temptation, and a fool's voice with many words; when thou vowest a vow to God delay not the performance of it. For in fools there is no fixed will. Pay thou therefore what thou vowest. It is better not to vow, than to vow and not perform. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin, nor say in the presence of God, It was an inadvertence, that God may not be provoked to wrath by thy voice, and destroy the works of thy hands, because it was with a multitude of dreams and vanities, and many words that thou fearest God.

If thou seest a frivolous accusation of a poor man, and a rigorous exaction of judgment and justice in a country, marvel not at the matter. Because there is a high one over a high one to watch, and high ones are for these things, and the profit of land is for every one, a king is appendant to the cultivated field. A lover of silver cannot be satisfied with silver; but did any one ever love what the abundance of this produceth?

Surely this is vanity. By an abundance of wealth they who consume it are multiplied. And what is the mighty advantage of the owner from it? That he hath the first sight of it with
12 his eyes? The sleep of the slave is sweet whether he eateth little or much. But the fulness of the rich suffereth him not to sleep.

13 There is a weakness which I have seen under the sun—

14 riches kept by one for his descendant to his own hurt. Yet these riches acquired with grievous vexation shall perish, and

15 he hath begotten a son, and there is nothing in his hand. As he came naked out of his mother's womb, he shall turn about and go as he came. He shall take nothing by his labour to go

16 with him in his hand. Surely this is a grievous weakness; for as he came, so he must depart. What then is his lasting

17 advantage, for which he laboureth in vain; and for which all his days are in darkness and mourning, and much grief and weakness and repining?

18 Behold I have seen a good which is comely, namely to eat and drink, and to have a good enjoyment in all the labour with which one toileth under the sun, the number of the days of his life which God hath given him; for this is his portion.

19 And every man indeed to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and granted him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, hath by means of his being made glad in his labour,

20 this further gift of God, that he will not much remember the days of his life, because God occupieth him with the joy of his heart.

VI. There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it

2 is common among men—a man to whom God giveth riches and wealth and glory, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he can desire; but God granteth him not a power

3 to eat thereof. In as much as a stranger is to devour it, this is vanity and grievous infirmity. Though a man should beget a hundred children and live many years, if during that multitude of years which his days shall continue, his soul shall not be satisfied with an enjoyment of good, and he hath got no burying place, I conclude that an Abortive is better than he.

4 Grant that it came in vanity and goeth away in darkness; with

5 darkness also his name shall be covered! It indeed never saw

6 the light; and he never knew rest: it hath an advantage over him though he had lived the revolutions of a thousand years, if he never enjoyed good. Do not all go to one place?
7 All the labour of a man is for the mouth; yet the appetite will not be satisfied: here then a wise man hath the advantage over a fool; since the poor man knoweth that to pass through life, what he sees with the eyes is better for him than to be wandering after appetite, which is indeed vanity and vexation of spirit.

10 Whatever hath been is now called by its name, and it is known what man is who cannot contend with one who is stronger than he.

11 Since there are many arguments to prove the abundance of vanity; is there any one thing better than another for man?

12 Doth any one know what is good for man in this life? All the days of his life of vanity he hath indeed done these things under a shade; is there any who can tell him what will be after him under the sun?

VII. A good name is better than precious oil; and the day of death, than a birth day. It is better to go to a house of mourning than to a house of feasting. As that is the end of every man therefore the living will improve his understanding.

3 Grief is better than laughter; for by a sadness of countenance a heart may be made better. The heart of the wise is in a house of mourning; but the heart of fools, in a house of mirth. It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise, than to listen to the song of fools. Like the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of fools. Surely this also is vanity. Because oppression distracteth a wise man and destroyeth his good disposition, the final sentence is better than such a government. Better is a patient man than one of a haughty spirit.

9 Be not apt to be grieved in spirit; for grief will rest in the bosom of fools. Say not, How happened it that the former days were better than these? For thou hast not inquired wisely concerning this. Wisdom is good with an inheritance; and it is an advantage to them who see the sun, that they are in the shade of it. Wisdom is like the shade of money; but the advantage of the knowledge of wisdom is—it will give life to him who is a follower of it. Contemplate the works of God; for who can make him straight whom God hath made crooked.

14 In the days of prosperity enjoy good; but consider in the day of adversity—consider that God hath made the one in due
proportion to the other, forming a whole, as hath been said, that man cannot find out any of his ways.

15 In the days of my vanity I took a view of all classes. Here is a righteous man perishing for his righteous act: there a wicked man continuing in his wickedness. Be not over righteous; nor dive too far into wisdom, lest peradventure thou be struck with astonishment. Run not into an excess of wickedness nor become hardened, that thou mayst not die untimely.

18 It is good to restrain thyself in the one case; and surely for the other consideration thou shouldst not pollute thy hand. Because to them who fear God all things may happen, wisdom will help the wise man more than ten mighty men who are in the city. Because there is not a righteous man on earth who will do good and not commit sin, therefore thou shouldst not pay too close attention to all the words which the wicked shall utter, that thou mayst not hear thy servant cursing thee. For many a time he may revile thee and in many ways vex thy heart, because thou perhaps in like manner didst curse others.

23 Having proved all these things by wisdom, I said, Let me investigate the cause. But that was far removed from me; farther than it was. It is indeed a deep depth, who can find it out?

25 I took a circuit with my heart to know and examine carefully and to seek wisdom and a mode of calculating, and to gain a knowledge of a particular folly and disquietude and madness of one destitute of the fear of God; and I find and can declare, That bitterer than death is that whole class of women who are prostitutes. Though their heart is nets and their hands chains, he who is good in the sight of God shall be delivered from them; but a sinner shall be taken by them. Behold this I found (said the preacher) examining them one by one to find a class which my soul earnestly sought, but I did not find: though I found one man of a thousand, yet a woman among all these I did not find: but behold this I found, that God made mankind upright; but they have found out many classes.

VIII. Doth any one know wise men? Doth any one know the solution of a matter? Wisdom will make his countenance shine; but one of an unblushing countenance will be hated.

2 Watch the mouth of a king, and in regard to the oath of
3 God be not impatient. From his presence thou mayst withdraw. Stay not when he giveth wicked orders; for he will do what he pleaseth, as a king is absolute; and who can say to him, What dost thou? He who keepeth a command will not acknowledge it to be—a wicked order; but a wise man's heart knoweth the time of judgment, that—there is a time and a judgment for every thing. Because the man's determination may be much against him—because none knoweth what may happen, who can tell him what may come to pass? No man is absolute commander over wind to stop the current of it, and over the day of death he hath no authority; nor is there a discharge in the day of battle; nor can wickedness save him who is under its sway.

9 Having taken a view of this as a whole, I applied my heart to every work which is done under the sun—to all those things in which man exerciseth authority over man to his hurt. And I then saw wicked men carried to their graves, even out of this holy place; and when they were gone, they were praised in the city, because they had done as they did. Surely this is vanity. Because those who do evil are not speedily called to an account, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set in them to do evil. He who sinned continued thenceforward to do evil, even because of the forbearance shewn to them. Now as I know that it is good for them who fear God, that they should be awed by his presence; and that it cannot be well with the wicked; and that he who is not awed by the presence of God cannot prolong his days at ease; this which is practised on earth is vanity.

14 Because there are righteous men on whom cometh as it were the work of the wicked; and because there are wicked men on whom cometh, as it were, the work of the righteous,

15 I said that this is also surely vanity; and I praised pleasurable enjoyment, because there is nothing good for men under the sun—nothing save eating and drinking and being made glad; and this one may have conjoined with his labour all the days of his life which God giveth him under the sun.

16 In all those things to which I applied my heart to know wisdom and to take a view of the business which is done on the earth; because day and night this is never at rest, therefore
I took a view of all the works of God in classes; for man is incapable of finding out the whole system of things under the sun. Let a man labour ever so much in the search he cannot find it out; and let a wise man say ever so much of knowing he cannot find it; for this cause I laid this whole system before my heart, and my heart took a view of it. As the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God, man indeed knoweth not what to love or what to hate: with regard to all things before him there is vanity in them all. The same event happeneth to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good, and to the bad; to the clean and to the unclean; to him who sacrificeth and to him who sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; as is he who sweareth, so is he who feareth the oath. There is this evil in every thing done under the sun, that one event happeneth to them all, so that the heart of the children of men being filled with evil there is an instability in their heart during their life, and it followeth them to the dead.

Because whoever is in society with all the living hath hope—because the dog which is alive is better than the lion which is dead—because they who are alive must know that they shall die; but the dead are not sensible of any thing and there is no more a portion for them—because the remembrance of these is forgotten, and their love and their hatred and their envy are already perished and they have no more forever a portion in any thing done under the sun; come eat thy bread with cheerfulness, and drink thy wine with a good heart: because God hath approved of thy works, let thy garments be always white; and let not oil be wanting on thy head: enjoy life also with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy life of vanity, which are given thee under the sun; for this is thy portion in this life of thine, and this thy labour with which thou toilest under the sun. Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might; since there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the mansion of the dead to which thou must go.

Having turned about, I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the mighty; nay not even bread to the wise, nor riches to men of understanding; nor favour to men of knowledge—that time and chance will happen to them all as forming one whole. That man indeed no more
knoweth his time than the fishes which are enclosed in an evil dredge, or than birds which are caught in a net. Like them the sons of men are drawn into an evil time when it cometh upon them suddenly.

13 This also I saw under the sun in regard to wisdom which with me is in high estimation. There was a small city and few men in it. And there came against it a mighty king who besieged it and built great ramparts against it; but he happened to find in it a poor wise beggar, and this man by his wisdom saved the city; yet no man remembered the class of this poor beggar. Now I have said, Wisdom is better than power, yet the wisdom of this poor man is despised and his words are not regarded. The words of wise men in a time of rest are more minded than the shout of men exercising authority in the business of folly. Wisdom is better than implements of war. One sinner indeed will destroy much good. Dead flies will spoil the best prepared perfumes: but the smallest portion of wisdom is of more value than the greatest glory of folly. The heart of a wise man is on his right: but the heart of a fool is at his left. In every way at least when a fool is on his march his heart will fail him so that all which he shall devise is folly.

4 If the spirit of a ruler rise up against thee, resign not thy place: for a reconciliation will mollify great offences.

5 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun as if something involuntary came forth from the presence of a person in authority. The fool is set in high stations while the rich shall sit in a low place. I have seen slaves on horseback and princes walking like slaves on the ground.

8 He who diggeth a pit may fall into it; and him, who is clearing away a hedge, a serpent may bite. He who raiseth stones high may be overpowered by them; and he who cleareth wood will thereby incur danger. If the axe shall fall, or one blunteth its edge and redoubled force is to be applied; the advantage will be in favour of the man who hath skill. If a serpent biteth at an interval of charming, there is then no advantage in him who charmeth. The words of a wise man's mouth are a charm; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. The beginning of the words of his mouth is folly and the end of his talk is malicious madness. Though the fool multiplieth words, a man doth not.
know what the matter is; and what that shall be which will follow who can tell him. The labour of the foolish will tire them like that of one who knoweth not the way to a city.

Alas for thee, O city, whose king is a novice and whose chiefs eat in the morning. Happy thou, O land, whose king is a son of freemen and whose chiefs eat in due season for strength: and that they may not be put to shame. By slothfulness the roof will fall, and by idleness of hands a house will become leaky, so as to excite a derision of them who are providing bread and wine and oil that they may be regaled while living. But to the subjection of money all things will be obedient. Therefore curse not a king in thy mind, and in the inmost recesses of thy bed-chamber curse not a rich man: for a bird of the air will carry thy voice, and that which hath wings will tell thy saying.

Send away thy bread on the face of the water; for after many days thou shalt find it. Give a portion to seven and even to eight; for thou knowest not what evil may be on the earth. When the clouds are filled with rain they empty themselves on the earth: and if a tree falleth, whether it be to the south or north, in the place where it shall fall there it shall be.

He who observeth the wind will not sow; and he who looketh at the clouds will not reap. In these cases there is no knowing which way the wind will blow. As thou knowest not how bones are formed in the womb of her who is with child; so thou canst not know the works of God—all that he shall do forming one system. In the morning sow thy seed; and in the evening let not thy hand forbear; for thou knowest not which will succeed, whether this or that; and should both prosper alike, they are good.

Light is indeed sweet, and it is grateful to the eyes to view the solar system; yet because, though a man may live many years and be delighted in them all, he will still remember that the days of darkness are many; that all that is coming is vanity; rejoice then, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart spotless and not by the sight of thine eyes, and know that for all these things God will bring thee to judgment. Therefore remove wrath from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh.
XII. Because youth and thoughtfulness is vanity, therefore remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth; before the evil days come and the years draw nigh in which thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them. So long as the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are not involved in darkness, the clouds will return after rain. When once the guards of the house are shaken, and the men of valour put to flight, and the grinding maids are idle, because reduced to a few, then shall the maids who look out at the windows be darkened, and the doors of the market place will be shut at the feebleness of the voice of the grinding maid, which will be raised to the plaintive tone of the young ostrich; and all the daughters of the song will be brought low; and they will look up to the height and there are terrors in the way. Though the almond tree shall have bloomed and the locust hath been fattened and the caper bush is shed, because the man is gone to his long home, therefore the mourners have made a circuit in the market place. Until the silver cord can be wound up no more, and the golden bowl be broken, and the bucket broken at the well, and the wheel on the well shall run down with it, and dust return to dust as it was, and the spirit return to God who gave it, vanity of vanities, said the preacher; all things are vanity.

And moreover, because the preacher was wise, because he taught mankind wisdom; that the ear might find what is comely from parables, the preacher made diligent search to find pleasing words and a writing of rectitude—words of truth. The words of the wise are like goads and nails ready made, which have been laid up in repositories from one shepherd to another. What remaineth of them, my son, keep thou. There is no end of making many books. And much study is a weariness to the flesh.

As a conclusion of the discourse, hear thou the whole sum and substance.—Fear God and keep his commandments: for this conclusion every man should draw, That God will bring the whole work into judgment in every case not taken notice of, whether it be good or whether it be evil.
A Song of Songs which is Solomon's.

2 LET him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.
3 Because thy breasts are better than wine; and the fragrance of thine odours is above all perfumes—Thy name out-poured oil, therefore the virgins have loved thee. Thou art drawn: after thee we will run to the fragrance of thy perfumes.
    The king brought me into his inner apartment.
    Let us rejoice and be gladdened by thee. We will love thy breasts better than wine: rectitude hath loved thee.
5 I am brown but comely, O daughters of Jerusalem; like the tents of Kedar—like the curtains of Solomon. Look not on me, because I am of a dark complexion—Because the sun hath looked upon me. My mother's children quarrelled with me—They made me a keeper in the vineyards. Mine own vineyard I did not watch.
7 Tell me thou whom my soul loveth, where thou tendest thy flock—Where thou causest it to rest at noon, perhaps I may be like a wanderer among the tents of thy companions.
8 If thou wouldst not make thyself known, O fairest of women; go out by thyself in the track of the flock; and feed thy kids by the shepherds tents.
9 To that steed of mine in Pharao's chariot I have compared thee, my love! What! thy cheeks are beautiful as a turtle dove's: and thy neck as strings of pearls. We will make for thee suitable figures of gold with spangles of silver.
12 While the king was at his banquet, my spikenard sent forth its odour. My dear brother is to me a nosegay of stacte:
14 it shall be lodged in my bosom. My dear brother is to me a cluster of the cypress, in the vineyards of Engaddi.
15 Behold thou art fair, my love; behold thou art fair. Thine eyes are doves.
16 Behold thou art comely, my dear brother—beautiful indeed! Near our bed thou wast shaded.
17 The beams of our houses are cedar. Cypress our vaulted cielings.

II.
1 I am a flower of the field, and a lilly of the vallies.
2 As a lilly among thorns, so is my consort among the daughters.
3 As the citron tree among the trees of the forests; so is my dear
brother among the youths. In its shade I took great delight and sat, and its fruit was sweet to my taste. O conduct me to the house of wine, and order for me what I love. Strengthen with perfumes—strew around me citrons, for I am wounded with love. Let his left hand be under my head, and his right embrace me!

I have adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and virtues of the field, that you stir not up nor awake my love till she please.

II. IT is the voice of my dear brother! lo he cometh, bounding over the mountains—skipping over the hills. My dear brother is like a roe; or a young hart on the mountains of Baithor. Lo! he 'is behind our wall, looking in at the windows, taking a near view through the lattice. My dear brother addressing me saith, "Arise my love, my fair one, my dove! For lo! the winter is past—the rain is over: is gone. The flowers appear on the earth—the pruning season is come. The voice of the turtle is heard in our land. The fig tree hath put forth its green figs: the vines are in bloom—they have shed a fragrance. Arise, come my beloved, my fair one, my dove. Yes, come thou dove of mine: in the shelter of the rock near the wall. Shew me thy face and let me hear thy voice: for thy voice is sweet and thy countenance comely."

Catch for us the little foxes, that spoil vines: for our vines are in blossom. My dear brother is mine and I am his: he is feeding among the lillies. Till the day blow fresh and the shades be removed. Return—Be, O my dear brother, like a roe, or a young hart on the caverned mountains.

III. By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loved. I sought him but did not find him. I called him but he made me no answer. I will rise now and take a circuit in the city—in the places of publick resort and in the streets; and seek him whom my soul loveth. I sought him but did not find him. The watchmen who take their rounds in the city, met me. Saw ye him whom my soul loveth? It was but a little while after I parted from them, till I found him whom my soul loveth. I took hold of him and did not let him go till I brought him to my mother's house and into the chambers of her who con-
5 ceived me. I charged you, O daughters of Jerusalem by the powers and virtues of the field, not to stir up nor awake my love till he please.

III. WHAT is this coming up from the wilderness; like a column of smoke, fuming with myrrh and incense made of all the perfumer's powders?
7 It is the palanquin of Solomon, three score chiefs of the
8 chiefs of Israel are around it. All swordsmen expert in war. Every man with his sword on his thigh, for fear of danger by
9 night. King Solomon had made himself a palanquin of the
10 wood of Libanus. Its columns he made of silver, and his sofa was of gold. Its canopy was purple, and its inside carpeted with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.
11 O daughter of Sion go forth and view king Solomon; in the crown with which his mother crowned him; on the day of his espousals—

IV. Even on the day of the gladness of his heart. Behold, thou art fair, my love! Behold thou art fair! Thine eyes are doves, now thy veil is removed! thy hair is like the flocks of goats which are seen from mount Galaad: thy teeth like the flocks of shorn sheep; which have just come up from the washing pool: they are all twins and there is not one defective among them. Thy lips are like a braid of scarlet and thy speech is graceful: as the skin of a pomegranate, so are thy cheeks,
4 now thy veil is removed. Thy neck is like the tower of David, which was built for an armoury: on it are hung a thousand shields; all the javelins of the worthies. Thy two breasts are like two twin fawns of a roe; which are browzing among lillies. Till the day breeze spring up and the shades are removed, I will go by myself to the mountain of myrrh, and to
7 the hill of frankincense. Thou art altogether fair, my love; and there is no blemish in thee.

IV. COME from Libanus, my spouse; come from Libanus. Thou canst come, yes come safely from the top of Pistis—from the summit of Sanir and Hermon—from lions dens,
9 from the leopards mountains. Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister spouse: thou hast ravished my heart with a glance
10 of thine eyes—with an endearing turn of thy neck. How beautiful are thy breasts, my sister spouse! how much more pleasing than wine are thy breasts! and the smell of thy garments, than all spices! thy lips, my spouse, drop as a honey comb: honey and milk flow from thy tongue: and the fragrance of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. Thou art an enclosed garden, my sister spouse: a close shut garden; a sealed fountain. Thy productions are a paradise of pomegranates with delicious fruits; aromatic plants with the varieties of bal- sams—spikenard and saffron, sweet cane and cinnamon; with all kinds of trees of incense—myrrh, aloth with all the prin- cipal spices. A garden fountain and a well of living water, flowing with gentle murmurs from Libanus.

16 Awake O north wind, come also, O south wind and blow gently through my garden, and let my aromatic spices flow. Let my dear brother come down to his garden; and taste the delicious fruits thereof.

V. I have come to my garden, my sister spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spices: I have eaten my bread with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; drink—yes drink plentifully O brethren.

V. I SLEEP; but my heart is awake. The voice of my dear brother! he knocketh at the door! "Open to me, my sister, my dove, my consecrated one! for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night." I have put off my garment; how can I put it on? I have washed my feet; how can I defile them? My dear brother withdrew his hand from the hole in the door. Whereupon my bow- els yearned for him. I rose to open for my dear brother; my hands dropped myrrh; and my fingers myrrh plenteously on the handles of the bar. I opened for my dear brother. He was gone! my soul melted for the speech of him. I sought him but did not find him: I called him but he made me no answer. They who go the rounds in the city met me. They smote me—they wounded me. The keepers of the walls took my veil from me. I adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem by the powers and virtues of the field. If you found my dear brother—What should you tell him? Tell him that I am sick of love.
9 "What is thy dear brother more than another brother, O fairest of women? What is thy dear brother more than another brother, that thou hast thus adjured us?"

11 My dear brother is white and ruddy, he is the chiefest among tens of thousands. His head is gold of Kephas; his flowing locks black as a raven. His eyes are like doves by streams of water—milk white doves sitting by streams. His cheeks are like beds of spices emitting perfumes; his lips are lillies distilling myrrh plenteously. His hands are of gold, finely turned, beset with chrysolites: his body, an ivory cabinet on a sapphire stone: his legs, pillars of marble fixed on pedestals of gold: his countenance like Libanus, majestic as the cedars: his mouth is sweetness itself. He is altogether lovely. Such is my dear brother, and such my love, O daughters of Jerusalem.

VI. "Where did thy dear brother go, O fairest of women? Whither did thy dear brother bend his course; that we may seek him with thee?"

2 My dear brother went down to his garden to the beds of spices; to feed in the garden and to gather lillies. I am my dear brother's and he is mine; he is feeding among the lillies!

4 Thou my consort, art beautiful as Terzah; comely as Jerusalem; dazzling as embattled hosts! Turn thine eyes aside from me for they have transported me. Thy hair is like a flock of goats which are seen on mount Galaad: thy teeth like flocks of shorn sheep, just come up from washing: all twins and there is not one defective among them: thy lips are like a braid of scarlet, and thy speech is graceful. Thy cheek is like the downy skin of a pomegranate now thy veil is removed.

8 There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and virgins without number: one is my dove, my consecrated one. One is her mother's only child—the darling of her who bore her. Daughters viewed her—nay queens and even concubines will hail her happy and thus extoll her. "Who is she that is looking out like the morning; fair as the moon, distinguishable as the sun, and dazzling as embattled hosts."

VI. 11 I WENT down to the garden of nuts to look at the productions of the valley: to seek whether the vine had bud-
12 ded or the pomegranate blossomed: I am there to grant thee my breasts. My soul did not recollect this. It made me like the chariots of Aminadab.

13 Return, return, O Sunamite! return, return that we may see thee!

What would you see in the Sunamite, who is coming like the moving bands of an army?

VII. How beautiful were thy steps in thy sandals, O daughter of Nadab? The infoldings of thy loins are like jewellery, the work of an artist: thy clasp is a well turned goblet, not destitute of mingled wine: thy body is like a heap of wheat encompassed about with lillies: thy two breasts are like two twin fawns of a roe; thy neck is like a tower of ivory. Thine eyes like the pools at Eschbon by the gates of the daughter of many: thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looketh towards Damascus: thy head is like Carmel and the tresses of thy head like Purpura.

The king is detained in the antichamber!

6 How beautiful thou art! and how sweet! O my love! how delightful! In respect to thy stateliness, thou hast been compared to the palm tree, and thy breasts to its clusters. I said,

8 I will climb the palm tree—I will clasp its topmost boughs; and thy breasts shall be now like the clusters of the vine; and the smell of thy nose like citrons; and the roof of thy mouth like choice wine—

9 Which is poured out rightly for my dear brother properly adapted with my lips and my teeth. I am my dear brother's; and towards me is his desire. Come, my dear brother, let us go out to the fields. Let us lodge in the villages: let us get up early to the vineyards: let us see whether the vine is budded: whether the young grape has made its appearance: whether the pomegranates are in blossom. There I will grant thee my breasts. The mandrakes have shed a fragrance: and in our hoards are all manner of delicious fruits, newly gathered as well as old. For thee, my dear brother I have kept them. O

VIII. that thou, my dear brother, hadst sucked the breasts of my mother; meeting thee abroad I could kiss thee and not be despised; I could take thee and conduct thee to my mother's house; and to the inmost apartment of her who conceived me,
I could cause thee to drink spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranates; his left hand might be under my head and his right embrace me.

I have charged you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and virtues of the field; that you stir not up nor awake my love till she please.

WHO is this coming up cloathed in white leaning on her beloved?
Under a citron tree I awaked thee. It was there thy mother bare thee. There she who brought thee forth suffered the pangs of childbirth.

O set me as a seal on thy heart—as a seal on thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy inflexible as Hades: its wings are wings of fire—its flames—

Much water cannot quench love; nor can floods drown it. Though a man give all his substance for love, he may be thoroughly despised.

Our sister is little and hath no breasts. What can we do for our sister on the day when she shall be demanded in marriage. If she be a wall we will build on her silver turrets, and if she be a door we will line her with boards of cedar.

I am a wall and my breasts are turrets. I was in their view as one who had found favour. Solomon had a vineyard at Beelamon, he let this vineyard of his to tenants, a man is to give him a thousand pieces of silver for its fruit. My vineyard which is before me shall continue to be mine. Solomon shall have the thousand pieces of silver, and they who take care of its fruits, two hundred.

Thou who art sitting in the gardens, companions are waiting thy voice. Let me hear it—

Away, my dear brother, and be like a roe; or a young hart on the mountains of spices.
I. I. A vision which Esaias son of Amos saw, (which he saw respecting Judea and Jerusalem) in the reign of Ozias, and Joatham and Achaz and Hezekias, who reigned over Judea.

2 HEARKEN, O heaven! and hear O earth! what the Lord hath spoken.

"I have begotten children and brought them up; and they have rebelled against me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but Israel did not know me. And this people have not regarded me."

4 Ah! sinful nation—people full of sins! vile race! iniquitous children! you have utterly forsaken the Lord; and provoked to wrath the Holy One of Israel. What! must you persisting in iniquity be smitten still more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint: from the feet to the head, there is no soundness therein. Is it not, here a wound, there a bruise, there a putrefying sore? there is no applying poultice, nor oil, nor bandages. Your land is a desert: your cities are burnt with fire. As for your country, before your eyes strangers are devouring it; and it is laid waste, being subdued by foreign tribes. Must the daughter of Sion be left as a shed in a vineyard: and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers—as a city taken by siege? Had not the Lord of Hosts left us a seed, we should have been as Sodom and made like Gomorra. Hear a word of the Lord, O chiefs of Sodom! Attend to the law of God, ye people of Gomorra!

"What is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the Lord: I am cloyed with whole burnt offerings of rams: in the fat of lambs and the blood of bulls and goats I have no delight; nor should you come to appear before me: for who hath required these at your hands? You shall no more be admitted to tread my court. Though you bring fine flour; it is a vain incense—it is an abomination to me. Your new moons and sabbaths and great day I cannot endure: your fasting and cessation from labour; and your new moons and your festivals my soul hateth. You are become loathsome to me; I will no longer remit your sins. When you stretch forth your hands, I will turn mine eyes from you: and though you multiply prayer, I will not hearken to you: for your hands are full of blood. Wash and become clean: remove iniquities from your souls; in my presence, cease from your evil deeds; learn to do good;
17 seek judgment; deliver him who is injured; administer justice to the orphan, and plead the cause of the widow: then
18 come—(let our controversy be brought to issue, saith the Lord) and though your sins be as a purple stain; I will make you white as snow—though they be as a stain of scarlet; I will make
19 you white as wool. If you indeed be willing and will hearken
20 to me, you shall eat the good things of the land: but if you refuse and hearken not to me, the sword shall devour you; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken these words."
21 How is the faithful city become a harlot? Sion that was full of justice! In it righteousness made its abode; but now murderers.
22 Your silver is not pure: thy vintners mix the wine with water. The chiefs are rebellious; associates of thieves: they love gifts; they seek rewards: to orphans they do not administer justice; and to the cause of widows they do not attend. Therefore thus saith the sovereign Lord of hosts.
    "Alas for the rulers of Israel! for my wrath against these adversaries shall not abate. On these enemies of mine I will execute judgment: and I will bring my hand over thee, and purify thee with fire. Them who are disobedient I will destroy:
26 and I will take away from thee all transgressors, and establish thy judges as at the first: and thy counsellors as at the beginning: and after these things thou shalt be called The city of Righteousness, The faithful metropolis, Sion. For in the exercise of judgment her captivity shall be saved: and in the exercise of mercy, the lawless and sinful shall be crushed together; and they who have forsaken the Lord shall be utterly destroyed:
29 for they shall be exposed to shame for the idols on which they doted; as they have been for the gardens which they desired.
30 For they shall be like an ilex, which hath shed its leaves; and like
31 a garden which hath no water: and their strength shall be like tow; and their works like sparks of fire: and the lawless and sinful shall be burned up together; and there shall be no extinguisher."

II. II. The word which came to Esaias, son of Amos concerning Judea and concerning Jerusalem.

2 BECAUSE in the last days, the mount of the Lord will be conspicuous; and the house of God will be on the top
of mountains; and exalted above the hills: therefore all the nations will come to it. Many nations indeed, will go saying,
    "Come, let us go up to the mount of the Lord; and to the house of the God of Jacob. And he will teach us his way, and we will walk therein."
For from Sion shall go forth a law; and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he will judge among the nations; and work conviction in many a people: and they shall beat their swords into plough shares; and their spears into pruning hooks: and nation shall not lift up a sword against nation; nor shall they learn war any more.
Now therefore, O house of Jacob; come, let us walk in the light of the Lord. For he hath forgiven his people, the house of Israel.
(J) "Because their land was filled as at first with divinations; like that of the Philistines and many strange children were born to them—for their country was filled with silver and gold, and there was no counting their treasures; and their land was filled with horses, and there was no end to their chariots; and the land was filled with abominations, the workmanship of their own hands; and they worshipped the things which their fingers had made, and the commoner bowed down and the noble humbled himself; therefore I will not forgive them."
"Now therefore go into the rocks and hide yourselves in the earth, from the tremendous presence of the Lord; and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall arise, to crush the land."
"For the eyes of the Lord are lofty; but man is low; and the loftiness of these men shall be humbled; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of hosts is against every scorner and haughty man; and against every one high and lofty, and they shall be humbled: even against every of those high towering cedars of Lebanon; and against every oak of Basan; and against every lofty mountain; and against every hill that is high; and against every stately tower; and against every high raised wall; and against every ship of the sea; and against every ensign of beauteous ships:

(J) Jehovah.
17 and every man shall be humbled; and the haughtiness of these men shall fall; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. Then will they hide all these handiworks, carrying them into caverns and clefts of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, from the tremendous presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall arise to crush the lands. For on that day men will cast to the bats their abominations both of silver and gold, which they made to worship vanities; that they may go into holes of the flinty rock—nay into the very clefts of the rock, from the tremendous presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall arise to crush the land.

III. Behold now the Sovereign Lord of hosts will remove, from Jerusalem and from Judea, all stay and support of every kind—the stay of bread and the stay of water; the giant and mighty man and warrior; judge and prophet; instructor and elder; the captain of fifty, and honourable counsellor; the skilful architect and intelligent scholar: and I will make boys their princes; and scorners shall rule over them. And upon one another the people will fall foul, and justle every man against his neighbour—the boy against the elder and the base against the honourable.

6 Because a man will take hold of his brother, or the head of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing be thou our leader, and let me be supplied with food under thee."

7 "Therefore on that day he will answer and say, I will not be thy leader, for in my house there is neither bread nor raiment, I will not be the leader of this people."

3 Because Jerusalem is forsaken and Judea is fallen therefore their tongues concur with their transgression. They disbelieve the things relating to the Lord. Because their glory is now humbled; and the shame of their countenance is risen up against them: their sin therefore, like the Sodomites, they proclaimed and openly avowed. Alas for their souls! because they have counselled an evil counsel against themselves, saying, "Let us bind the just one, for he is disagreeable to us;" let them therefore eat the fruits of their deeds. Alas for the wicked! according to the works of his hands evils shall befall
12 him. O my people! your task masters glean you; and exactors tyrannize over you. O my people! They who call you happy lead you astray; and disturb the path of your feet. But the Lord will now arise to plead his cause; and he will arraign his people. The Lord will himself come to a trial with the elders of the people and with their chiefs: "Why have you burned up my vineyard? And why is the plunder of the poor in your houses? Why do you injure my people; and cover with shame the face of the poor.

16 Thus saith the Lord, Because the daughters of Sion are haughty and have walked with outstretched neck and wanton eyes, trailing with them in their gait flowing robes, and moving in set pace with their feet; therefore God will humble the princely daughters of Sion and the Lord will expose their form to view. On that day the Lord will take away the finery of their attire, the cauls and the curls and the crescents, the solitaire and the ornament of the brow, and the gorgeous wreathed tiar, and the necklaces and the bracelets, and the zone and the rings for the fingers, and the ornaments for the right arms, and the ear-rings and the robes with purple borders, and those the middle of which is purple, and the dresses worn at home, and the Laconian gauzes and cotton robes, and those of purple and scarlet and cotton, embroidered with gold and purple; and the summer sophas: and instead of perfumes there shall be ashes; and instead of a girdle thou shalt be girded with rushes; and instead of a golden head-dress thou shalt have baldness, on the account of thy doings; and instead of the purple robe thou shalt gird on sackcloth. And thy son the most beautiful whom thou lovest shall fall by the sword; and your mighty men shall fall by the sword and be laid low; and your wardrobes shall mourn; and thou shalt be left solitary and shalt sit

IV. on the ground; and seven women shall lay hold on one man, saying, "We will eat our own bread and wear our own raiment, let us only be called by thy name: take thou away our reproach."

2 "But in that day God will with glorious counsel shine on the land, to exalt and dignify the remnant of Israel. And it shall come to pass that what is left in Sion, and what is left in Jerusalem shall be called Holy. Namely all who are enrolled
4 for life in Jerusalem. Because the Lord will wash away the filth of the sons and the daughters of Sion, and cleanse the blood entirely from among them; by a spirit of judgment and
5 a spirit of burning; therefore when he shall come, every part of Sion and all around it shall be overshadowed by day with a cloud as of smoke, and by night with that of the light of
6 blazing fire; and with all this glory it shall be covered; and this will be a shade from heat, and it shall be in a shelter and covert from storm and rain."

V. III. Let me sing for the Beloved, a song of my Beloved to his vineyard.

THE beloved had a vineyard on a mountain in a rich soil,
2 "and I hedged it around and trenched it; and planted it with the vine of Sorek; and in the midst of it built a tower, and hewed out therein a wine lake; and waited for its producing grapes, and it produced poisonous berries.
3 "Now therefore, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Juda, judge between me and my vineyard. What more could I do for my vineyard that I have not done for it? Because I expected that it would produce grapes, and it hath produced
5 poisonous berries; now therefore I will tell you, what I purpose to do with my vineyard; I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be exposed to plunder; and I will demolish its
6 wall, and it shall be for a common walk; and I will abandon my vineyard that it may neither be pruned nor digged; and brambles shall overrun it as a waste; and I will give a charge
7 to the clouds not to shed rain upon it. For the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel; and the men of Juda his beloved plant. I waited for their executing justice, but they committed injustice, and promoted not righteousness, but an outcry.
8 Woe unto them who join house to house, and who are bringing field nearer to field, that they may take something
9 from their neighbour. Are you alone to dwell in the land? For these things have come to the ears of the Lord of Hosts. For though there be many houses they shall be for desolation—though great and fair, there shall be no inhabitants therein.
10 For the ground worked by ten yoke of oxen will not yield a bath of wine; and he who soweth six measures shall not raise three.
11 Woe to them, who rise early to follow strong drink, and continue at it till late at night; for the wine will inflame them.
12 For with kithara and psaltery, tabors and pipes, they drink wine; but they regard not the works of the Lord, nor consider
13 the operations of his hands. Therefore my people are become captives, because they did not know the Lord; and multitudes
14 have died of famine and thirst; and Hades hath enlarged its appetite, and opened its mouth, that there may be no want of room; and down shall go the honourable and the great, and
15 the rich and the pestilent men of the land. The commoner shall be humbled; and the noble dishonoured; and the lofty eyes
16 shall be brought down; and the Lord of Hosts shall be exalted in judgment; and God, the Holy One, shall be glorified by righteousness; and they who have been plundered shall be fed like bulls, and lambs shall graze the waste places of them who have been removed.
18 Woe unto them who draw out sins as for a long cable; and
19 iniquities as for an ox chain: who say, "Let what he is to do approach speedily that we may see; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come that we may know it."
20 Woe to them who call evil good; and good evil—who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet; and sweet for bitter.
21 Woe to them who are wise in their own conceit, and in their own eyes prudent.
22 Woe to your mighty men who drink wine; and to your princes who mingle strong drink: who justify the wicked for rewards; and deprive the just of his right. For this cause, as stubble will be set on fire by a coal, and consumed by a neglected flame; their root shall be like touch wood, and their blossom shall ascend like dust: for they desired not the law of the Lord of Hosts: but provoked to wrath the manifestation of the Holy One of Israel. Wherefore the Lord of Hosts was incensed against his people, and he stretched out his hand against them and smote them: and the mountains were convulsed, and their carcasses were as dung in the high way: and for all this his anger was not turned away; but still his hand is high.
26 Therefore he will erect a standard among the nations far off, and summon them from the extremity of the earth: and be-
27 hold! with speed they are coming swiftly. They will not hunger, nor will they be weary: they will not slumber, nor lie down to sleep; nor shall their girdles be loosed from their loins, nor the latchets of their sandals broken. Their arrows are sharp, and their bows are bent: the hoofs of their horses have been accounted as flint, and the wheels of their chariots are like a whirlwind. They growl like lions, and are at hand like young lions. He will seize and roar like a wild beast and drive out the people, and there shall be none to deliver them.

30 On that day he will roar against them like the roaring of the billowy sea; and they will look upwards to the heaven and down on the earth; and lo! distressful darkness in their tribulation.

A solemn Vision.

VI. IV. IN the year in which Ozias the king died I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne; and the house was filled with his glory. And seraphs stood around him, each having six wings; and with two they covered the face, and with two they covered the feet, and two they used in flying. And they cried one to another and said,
    "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is filled with his glory."
4 And the lintel of the door was shaken with the sound of their cry, and the house was filled with smoke. Whereupon I said, Ah! woe is me! (for I was confounded) for being a man, and having unclean lips; and dwelling among a people of unclean lips, I have seen with mine eyes the king the Lord of Hosts. Then one of the seraphs was sent to me and he had in his hand a live coal which he had taken from the altar with the tongs. And having touched my lips he said, Behold this hath touched thy lips, and it will take away thine iniquities and purge away thy sins. Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send? And who will go to this people? And I said, Behold, here am I: send me. And he said,
    Go and say to this people; hearing you shall hear, though you may not understand: and seeing you shall see, though you may not perceive: for the heart of this people is stupefied; and their ears are dull of hearing; and they have shut their eyes, that for a while they may not see with their eyes; and hear with
their ears; and understand with their hearts; and return that I may heal them.

11 Whereupon I said, For how long? O Lord! And he said,
    Until cities be wasted so as not to be habitable; and houses,
    so that there be no men; and the land be left utterly desolate:
12 And after this God will remove the men far away.
    They indeed who are left in the land shall be multiplied;
13 for still about the tenth is in it; and shall again be for a prey,
    and be like the ilex and like the oak when it hath fallen from its station.

VII. V. IN the days of Achaz the son of Joatham, the son of Ozias king of Judah, Rasin king of Aram and Phakec son of Romelias king of Israel came up against Jerusalem to war
2 against it, but could not lay close siege to it. When the house of David was informed that Aram had confederated with Ephraim, the heart of the king and the heart of his people was
3 moved, as a tree in the forest is shaken by the wind. Whereupon the Lord said to Esaias, Go out and meet Achaz, thou and
4 Forsaken-jasub thy son, at the pool on the upper road to the fuller’s field, and thou shalt say to him,
    Take heed and be quiet; be not terrified, nor let thy soul be dismayed on the account of these two smoaking firebrands: for when my fierce wrath is come I will again heal.
5 And as for the son of Aram and the son of Romelias; because they have taken evil counsel, saying, Let us go up to Judea and confer with the people and bring them into our
7 measures; and let us make the son of Tabeel king over it, thus saith the Lord of hosts. This counsel shall not stand; nor shall
8 it take effect. But the head of Aram shall be Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rasin—but further, in three score and five years, the kingdom of Ephraim shall cease from being a people,
9 though Somoron is the head of Ephraim, and the son of Romelias, the head of Somoron, yes though you may not believe nor understand.
10 Moreover the Lord proceeded to speak to Achaz saying,
11 "Ask thee a sign from the Lord thy God in the depth or in
12 the height." And Achaz said, "I will not ask, nor will I try
13 the Lord." Thereupon he said, Hear now, O house of David,
Is it a small matter for you to contend with men? How is it then that you contend with the Lord? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign.

14 Behold the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and he shall be called Emmanuel.

15 Doth this child,* before it hath known to chuse good in preference to evil, eat butter and honey, because previous to its knowing good or evil it disobeyeth evil to make choice of good? The land indeed which thou fearest on account of these two kings shall be relinquished; but God will bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon the house of thy father days which have not yet come. From the day he hath taken Ephraim from Juda [he will bring] the king of the Assyrians. It shall come to pass that at that time the Lord will utter a call to the flies—to that part of them which rule over the river of Egypt; and to the bee which is in the country of the Assyrians; and they shall all come into the vallies of this country; and into the holes of the rocks; and into the caves and into every cleft. On that day the Lord will shave with that razor—with that which was hired on the bank of the river—with that of the king of the Assyrians, the head and the hair of the feet: and take off the beard. And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man will keep a young cow and two sheep; and by reason of the abundance he will drink milk—butter and honey will be eaten by every one left in the land. And it shall come to pass in that day every where, though there may be a thousand vineyards, each valued at a thousand shekels income: they shall be for briars and thorns. With bows and arrows men will resort thither. Because the whole country shall be a waste of briars and thorns, therefore every mountain which hath been ploughed will be ploughed, wherever terror could not come; for by reason of the country’s being a waste of briars and thorns, it shall be a pasture for sheep and a range for the ox.

VIII. Again the Lord said to me, Take thee a strip of a large new roll and write thereon with a man’s pen “Speed quickly to the plunder of the spoil,” for it is at hand. And let faithful men, Ourias and Zacharias son of Barachias be witnesses for me.

3 Now I had approached to the prophetess and she had con-

* Pointing to his son Jasub.
ceived and when she brought forth a son, the Lord said to me,
4 Call his name "Speed to the spoil—haste to the prey" for before this child shall know to pronounce father or mother, the van of the king of Assyria will take the army of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria.

5 Again the Lord spoke yet further to me saying, Because
6 this people reject the water of Siloam which floweth gently and chuse to have Rasin and the son of Romelias to rule over them;
7 therefore behold the Lord will bring upon you the water of the river which is strong and abundant—even the king of Assyria and his glory; and he will rise over all your channels, and over-
8 flow all your banks; and sweep away from Judea every man who can raise his head, or is capable of executing any thing. And the circuit of his camp shall be such as to fill the breadth
9 of thy country, O Emmanuel. Know this, O nations, and be struck with consternation. Hearken ye who are in the remotest parts of the earth; be struck with consternation ye who have made yourselves strong; for though you should again become
10 strong; with consternation you shall again be stricken, and what counsel soever you may take, the Lord will defeat it; and what word soever you may speak shall not take effect among you;
11 because God is with us:
    Thus saith the Lord with the strong hand, to them who refuse to walk in the way of this people saying, Perhaps they
12 may order what is hard—(for whatever this people order is hard.)

    Be not ye terrified with the fear of them, nor dismayed; hal-
13 low the Lord himself, and let him be thy fear: for if thou hast put
14 trust in him he will be to thee a sanctuary, and you shall not run against a stumbling stone, nor as under a falling rock. But as for the houses of Jacob, they are in a trap, and the inhabitants
15 of Jerusalem are in a pit: for this cause many among them shall be weak and fall and be trodden down and men will safely ap-
16 proach and take them. Then shall they be manifest who seal
17 up the law that it may not be learned. Then will one say, "I will wait for God, who hath turned away his face from the house of Jacob; and I will trust in him. Here am I and the children whom God hath given me."

18 Now when there shall be signs and wonders in the house of Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwelleth on Mount
19 Sion; if they should say to you, "Apply to the belly speakers, and to them who cause a voice to proceed from the ground." Those vain babblers who speak from the belly: should not a nation apply to their God? Why consult they the dead concerning the living? For he hath given a law for assistance; that they may not speak like such an oracle as this, which is not worth the giving of gifts for it. Upon you indeed there shall come a grievous famine; and it shall come to pass that when you are hungry, you will fret and curse the ruler and the customs of your country. And they will look up to the heaven above, then down on the earth beneath, and lo distress and darkness! tribulation and anguish and a gloom so as not to see! But he who is in distress for a season shall not be abandoned to despair. Drink this first; do it quickly. With regard to the region of Zabulon, the land of Nephthaleim and the rest who inhabit the sea shore, and the banks of the Jordan, Galilee of the nations; ye people who walk in darkness, behold! a great light! and ye who dwell in a region, the shade of death, on you a light shall shine.

3 With regard to the bulk of the people, whom thou hast brought back in thy joy, they shall rejoice in thy presence, like them who rejoice in harvest, and like them who are dividing spoils; because the yoke which lay upon them, is taken away, and the rod which was over their neck. For he hath broken the rod of the exactor, as in the day of Madiam: for, with a renewal of friendship, they shall make compensation for every robe collected by deceit, and for every garment; and shall be willing to do so, if they were burned with fire: because for us a child is born, and to us a son is given, whose government is on his own shoulder; and his name is called, "The Messenger of Great Counsel." For I will bring peace on the rulers and health for him. His government shall be great and to his peace there is no boundary, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to re-establish it, and support it with judgment and justice, henceforth and forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.

VI. 8 THE LORD hath sent death against Jacob; and it hath come upon Israel. And all the people of Ephraim shall know it, and all the inhabitants of Samaria, who with haughtiness
10 and a lofty heart say, "The bricks are fallen; but come, let us hew stones and let us cut down sycamines and cedars and build for ourselves a tower."

11 Though God will dash down them, who rise up against him on mount Sion; and disperse his enemies—Syria in the east, and the Greeks in the west, who are devouring Israel with open mouth; for all this his anger is not turned away, but still his hand is lifted high.

13 The people did not turn till they were smitten; as they indeed did not seek the Lord; therefore the Lord cut off from Israel, head and tail, great and little in one day—the aged and the honourable, this was the head; and the prophet who teacheth falsehood, he is the tail. Still there will be deceivers, who will call this people happy, and lead them astray, that they may devour them; therefore the Lord will have no pleasure in their young men; and on their orphans and their widows he will have no compassion; because they are all wicked and regardless of law, and every mouth speaketh perversely. For all this his wrath is not turned away but still his hand is lifted high.

18 Still iniquity will burn like a fire, and like dry stubble it shall be consumed by fire. It shall burn in the thickets of the forest, and consume all on the hills around. By reason of the fierce anger of the Lord the whole country is in a flame; and the people shall be as fuel for the fire. A man will have no pity for his brother, but will turn to the right because he is hungry, and devour on the left, but shall not be satisfied. Man is devouring the flesh of his brother's arm; for Manasses is devouring Ephraim, and Ephraim, Manasses; for they will both together besiege Juda.

For all this his anger is not turned away; but still his hand is lifted high.

X. Wo to them who write wickedness! For writers are writing wickedness; turning aside the cause of the distressed; robbing the poor of my people, of their right; that the widow may be their prey and the orphan, their spoil: what then shall they do in the day of visitation? For tribulation shall come upon you from afar; and to whom can you flee for succour?
4 And where will you leave your glory, that you may not fall into the captive band?
    For all this his anger is not turned away, but still his hand is lifted high.
5 Ho! Assyrians!
6 The rod of my wrath, even mine anger is in their hands, I will send this anger of mine to a lawless nation; and I will order this people of mine to gather spoil and take the prey, and to
7 trample down cities and lay them in the dust. But he did not harbour such thoughts; nor did he reason thus in his mind; but his mind will prompt him to destroy nations not a few.
8 Even though they should say to him, Thou alone art chief.
9 He indeed will say,
    "Have I not taken the whole country above Babylon and Chalene, where the tower had been builded? Nay have I not
10 taken Arabia and Damascus and Samaria? In the same manner as I have taken these; so will I take all the governments.
11 Howl ye graven images in Jerusalem and in Samaria; for as I have done to Samaria and her images, so will I do to Jerusalem and her idols."
12 But it shall come to pass, when the Lord hath accomplished his whole work on mount Sion and Jerusalem; that I will cast a look on the stout heart—on the chief ruler of the Assyrians, and on the loftiness of the glory of his eyes.
13 For he said, "With this power I will perform exploits; and by the wisdom of mine understanding I will remove the
14 boundaries of nations, and make a prey of their strength, and shake inhabited cities, and seize with my hand the whole world as a nest; and carry off the inhabitants like deserted eggs. There is none who can escape me or chirp against me."
15 Shall an axe boast without him who cutteth with it; or a saw lift itself up, without him who draweth it; as one could lift up a staff or a piece of wood? No; this shall not be per-
16 mitted: indeed the Lord of hosts will send disgrace on thy
17 honour, and on thy glory a burning fire shall be kindled: and the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and shall hallow him with a burning fire, and consume his substance like dry grass.—
18 On that day there shall be an extinction of the mountains, and the hills, and the forests; and it shall consume from the
soul even to the flesh: and he who fleeth shall be like one fleeing from blazing fire. And those of them who are left shall be few in number, so that a child may write them down. And it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel shall no more join, nor shall those of Jacob who have escaped, any more lean on them who have injured them; but they will place their confidence in God the Holy One of Israel, in truth. This remnant of Jacob shall indeed be for the Mighty God. Yes: though the people of Israel be as the sand of the sea, this remnant of them shall be saved. He is closing an account and making a deduction with saving goodness. Because with the whole land the Lord will make a reckoning from which a deduction hath been made, therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts,

"O my people who dwell in Sion, be not daunted at the Assyrian, because he will smite thee with a rod; for I am bringing this stroke upon thee that thou mayst see the way of Egypt. For yet a little while and mine indignation shall cease; and my wrath will be against their counsel; and God will raise against them a scourge similar to that of Madiam at the place of affliction.

When his wrath shall be in the western road—in the high way leading to Egypt; it shall come to pass in that day, that his yoke shall be taken from thy shoulder, and the terror of him from thee—his yoke shall be utterly destroyed from off thy shoulders. For he will come to the city Aggai, and pass on to Mageddo; and at Machmas he will deposit his baggage: then he will pass the valley and come to Aggai. Terror will seize Rama the city of Saul; the daughter of Galleim will flee: he will be heard of at Laisa—he will be heard of at Anathoth.

When Madebena hath fainted; then, O inhabitants of Gibbeir, comfort with the news of his halting a day on his march—with the hand comfort the mount, the daughter of Sion. And as for you, O hills, which are in Jerusalem, behold the sovereign Lord of hosts, with majesty confoundeth the glorious. They who are elated with arrogance shall be crushed; and the lofty shall be brought low; yes, the lofty shall fall by the sword; and Libanus shall fall with the lofty.

XI. And there shall spring up a shoot from the root of Jessai—even from that root shall spring up a blooming shoot; and the
spirit of God will rest upon him—a spirit of wisdom and understanding; a spirit of counsel and majesty; a spirit of knowledge and piety—by this spirit he will be filled with the fear of God. He will not judge according to opinion, nor will he reprove according to report; but he will administer justice to the lowly, and work conviction in the meek of the earth. And he will smite the earth with the word of his mouth, and with a breath from his lips destroy the wicked. His loins will be girded with saving goodness, and his reins clothed with truth.

And a wolf shall pasture with a lamb; and a leopard shall lie down with a kid; and the calf, and bull and lion shall pasture together, and a little child shall tend them. The cow and bear shall feed together; and together their young shall herd; and the lion shall eat chaff like an ox. And the sucking child shall lay its hand on the holes of asps and on the bed of young asps.

And they shall not hurt nor have power to destroy any one on the mountain which is my sanctuary. Because the whole earth is filled with the knowledge of the Lord as abundant water covereth depths of seas; therefore there shall be in that day, the root of Jesse, even he who riseth up to rule nations: in him nations will put their trust, and his resting place shall be glorious. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord will proceed to shew his hand to provoke to jealousy the remnant of his people—that residue which is left from the Assyrians, and from Egypt and from Babylonia, and from Ethiopia and the Elamites, and from the risings of the sun and Arabia. And he will erect a standard for the nations, and gather together the outcasts of Israel, and assemble the dispersed of Juda from the four quarters of the earth. And the envy of Ephraim shall be taken away; and the enemies of Juda shall be destroyed: Ephraim shall not envy Juda; nor shall Juda vex Ephraim:

And they shall be wafted in the ships of foreign tribes; and they shall spoil both the sea and them of the east and Idumea: and upon Moab they shall first lay their hands; but the sons of Ammon shall first obey. And the Lord will dry up the sea of Egypt, and lay his hand on the river with a vehement wind: and smite the seven channels, so that they may be crossed dryshod. And there shall be a passage for my people left in Egypt. It shall be for Israel as on the day when they came up out of the land of Egypt.
XII. And on that day thou wilt say, I bless thee, O Lord; because, though thou wast angry with me, thou hast turned away thy wrath and pitied me. Behold! my God is my Saviour, I will trust in him and not be afraid. Because the Lord is my glory and my praise; and hath become unto me salvation; therefore draw ye water with gladness from the wells of thanksgiving.

Thou shalt say also on that day, O praise the Lord: invoke his name aloud! proclaim among the nations his glorious acts: call them up to your remembrance. Because his name is exalted; praise ye the name of the Lord. Because he hath done stupendous acts; proclaim them throughout the whole earth. Shout for joy and be glad, O inhabitants of Sion, for in the midst of it is exalted the Holy One of Israel.

XIII. VII. A vision which Esaias son of Amos saw respecting Babylon.

(J) ON a mount in the plain, erect a standard; raise the voice to them; beckon with the hand. Open O princes! it is I who command. It is I, who am leading these on. Giants are coming to execute my wrath, rejoicing and at the same time arrogant.

(p) A sound of many nations on the mountains! A tumultuous sound of many nations! A sound of kings and nations gathered together! the Lord of hosts hath issued orders to a nation trained for battle. They are come from a far distant country—from the extreme butment of heaven—the Lord and his trained warriors, to destroy all that inhabited land.

Raise the mournful cry! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and destruction from God will come: therefore every hand shall be enfeebled; and every man's heart shall be dismayed. The men in power shall be confounded; and pangs shall seize them, like those of a woman in travail. And they shall bewail their calamities, one to another, and be amazed; and their countenances will quiver like a flame. For behold the remediless day of the Lord is coming—a day of wrath and indigna-

(J) Jehovah, (p) the prophet.
tion, to make the empire a desolation; and to destroy the sinners out of it. For the stars of heaven—even Orion and the whole host of heaven, shall not give light; even that of the rising sun shall be darkened; and the moon shall not give her light.

(J) I will indeed order evils for the whole empire, and on the wicked their transgressions; and destroy the arrogance of the wicked; and humble the haughtiness of the proud; so that those left shall be more precious than tried gold and a man more precious than the ore of Souphir. For the heaven shall be filled with wrath; and the earth shaken from its foundations; at the fierce anger of the Lord of Hosts, on the day when his wrath shall come: and those left shall be like a chased roe and wandering sheep; and there shall be none to collect them together; so that they may return every man to his place, when every one shall be seeking his own country. For whoever is overtaken shall be thrust through and those collected in a body shall fall by the sword. And their infants shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; and their houses shall be plundered and their wives ravished. Behold I am raising up against you the Medes, who disregard silver and have no need of gold. They shall break the bows of the young men, and on your infants they will have no compassion; nor will their eyes spare thee for thy children. And Babylon, which is stiled Glorious, by the king of the Chaldeans, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorra. It shall not be inhabited for a great length of time, nor shall it be entered for many generations. The Arabians shall not pass through it; nor shall shepherds make their folds therein. But wild beasts shall there go to rest; and the houses shall be filled with howling. There jackals shall make their abode; and there demons shall hold their revels. And onocentauri shall inhabit there; and porcupines shall breed in the houses.

(p) He is coming quickly and will not tarry, but the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will still make choice of Israel; and they shall rest in their own land; and the stranger shall be joined to them, and shall be added to the house of Jacob. The nations shall take them and bring them to their place; and the house of Jacob shall possess them; when they shall be multiplied in their land, for men servants and for maid servants:
and they who captivated them shall be captives; and they who domineered over them shall be brought into subjection. And it shall come to pass in that day when the Lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and thy grief—from that hard servitude of thine, with which thou hast served them, that thou wilt take up this funeral song over the king of Babylon:

(c) "How the extortioner is laid to rest! and a stop put to his demands! The Lord hath broken the yoke of the sinners—the yoke of the rulers. He smote a nation in wrath with an incurable wound; he smote a nation with a vengeful wound which did not spare. The confidant is gone to rest; the whole earth shouteth for joy; and the trees of Lebanon rejoice over thee—and the cedars of Lebanon say,

"Since thou hast gone to rest, no feller is come up against us." Hades from beneath was in uproar to meet thee: for thee were roused all the giants who had ruled the earth. Having roused from their thrones all the kings of nations, they will all accost thee saying,

"And art thou caught as we have been? And among us art thou enrolled? Is thy pomp come down to Hades—all thy great festivity?" Beneath thee they will strew corruption for a bed; and worms shall be thy covering. How is Lucifer fallen from heaven! He who was harbinger of the morning—he who sent messages to all the nations, is trampled down into the earth.

Thou indeed didst say in thy heart, I will ascend up into heaven; above the stars of heaven I will place my throne; I will seat myself on a lofty mountain—on the lofty mountains which face the north. I will ascend above the clouds; I will be like the Most High. But thou must now go down to the mansion of the dead—even down to the foundations of the earth. They who see thee will express their amazement at thee and say, Is this the man who troubled the earth? who shook kings? who made the world a desert? who, when he destroyed cities, never dismissed his captives? All the kings of the nations have been composed to rest with honour, every man in his own house. But thou shalt be cast out on the mountains, like an abomi-

(c) the chorus.
nable corse, with dying crouds, pierced with the sword, descending down to the mansion of the dead.

20 As a mantle stained with blood cannot be clean; for the same cause neither canst thou be clean. Because thou hast destroyed this land of mine, and hast slain this my people; thou shalt not be of long continuance. Wicked seed, prepare thy sons for slaughter, for the sins of their fathers; that they may not rise and possess the land, and fill the world with wars. I will indeed rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and destroy their name and remnant and seed. Thus saith the Lord, I will lay Babylonia waste: that porcupines may inhabit it; and it shall be a desolation. And I will plunge it in the miry gulf of destruction. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, as I have spoken so it shall be; and as I have determined, so it shall stand. I will destroy the Assyrians on this land of mine: and on these mountains of mine they shall be trodden down; and their yoke shall be removed from my people; and their reproach shall be taken from their shoulders.

26 (p)This is the counsel which the Lord hath taken against the whole empire, and this is the hand which is lifted high against all the nations. For who can disannul what the holy God hath decreed? and his hand which is lifted high, who can turn aside?

VIII. In the year in which king Achaz died, this Oracle was delivered.

29 REJOICE not, foreign tribes, with one consent, because the yoke of him who smote you is broken; for from the seed of a serpent will come forth young asps, and their offspring will be flying serpents. For the needy will be fed by him; and in peace the needy will repose. But with famine he will destroy thy seed—even the remnant of thy seed he will destroy. Raise the mournful cry ye gates of cities; O foreign tribes! let harassed cities scream with one consent: for a smoke is coming from the north, which cannot be endured; what then will the kings of nations say in reply?

32 "That the Lord hath founded Sion, and by him the poor of his people shall be saved."
XV. IX.      The Oracle against Moab.

IN the night Moab is destroyed; for by night is destroyed the bulwark of Moab. Be in bitterness for yourselves; for Debon also is destroyed. Where your altar is, thither you will go up to weep for Nabau of Moab. Raise the mournful cry. On every head be baldness; let all your arms be gashed with wounds. In the streets thereof, gird on sackcloth, and on its house tops make lamentation; and in the streets thereof and in its lanes, raise ye all the mournful cry with weeping: because Escebon and Eleale have screamed—even to Jassa their voice hath been heard; therefore the lungs of Moab utter lowings; her soul will be afflicted. The heart of Moab within her uttereth lowings, which reach Segor: for she is a three headed heifer. At the ascent of Louith weepers will come up to thee; by the way of Aroniim destruction and dismay are roaring. The water of Nemereim will be dried up: and its grass will fail; there will be no green grass. But even thus it shall not be saved; for I will bring the Arabs against that valley; and they shall take it. For the cry of war touched the border of Moab at Agaleim, and the scream thereof reacheth even to the well of Aileim. As for the water of Deimon, it shall be full of blood; for I will bring the Arabians against Deimon, and carry off the seed of Moab and Ariel; and the remnant of Adama I will send away as reptiles on the earth. Is Petra a desert? There is the mountain of the daughter of Sion [to fly to] for thou shalt be—(like the young of a flown bird carried away) Thou, Moab, shalt be a vassal; and after that there will be a greater tribute of lambs. Take counsel [O Sion] and make for her every where a shelter from grief. In midnight darkness they will flee. They are confounded. Be not thou incensed. Let the fugitives of Moab sojourn with thee. They will be a shelter to you from the face of a pursuer. Because thy share in the war is taken away; and the chief who trampled down is destroyed from this land; therefore a throne shall be established with mercy, and on it one shall be seated with truth; in the tabernacle of David, executing justice, and searching out judgment and promoting righteousness.
6 (s) "We have heard of the haughtiness of Moab—he is very insolent."
    (J) This haughtiness I have totally removed.
7 "Is not this, is not this the oracle concerning thee? Moab shall raise the mournful cry, for in the country of Moab they shall all utter the cry of woe, but to them who dwell in the habitations of Seth thou shalt extend care and shalt not be ashamed." The plains of Esebon shall mourn—the vineyard of Sebama. Ye who drink up the nations, trample down her vineyards to Jazer. You need not march in close array: roam through the wilderness. They who were dispatched were wholly given up, for they passed through quite to the sea.
9 (p) Let me therefore weep, as with the weeping of Jazer, for the vineyards of Sebama. He hath cut down thy trees, O Esebon and Eleale.
    (J) Because in harvest and at thy vintage I will trample down and all shall be laid prostrate; therefore gladness and the shout of joy shall be taken from the vineyards. And in thy vineyards they shall not rejoice, nor tread out wine in thy cisterns, for a stop is put to the shout of joy.
10 (p) For Moab therefore will my bowels sound like a kithara, and my entrails, as when thou didst consecrate a wall; but it will be for the purpose of making thee ashamed. Because Moab had tired himself at the altars, therefore he will go in to the works of his hands; that they may intercede; but they shall not be able to deliver him.
13 This is the decree which the Lord pronounced against Moab, when he spoke. And now I say, within three years of the years of an hireling the glory of Moab shall be debased with all his abundant wealth; and he shall be left few in number and of no estimation.

XVII. X. The Oracle against Damascus.
    BEHOLD Damascus shall be removed from among cities, and shall be for desolation—left for ever for the folding of flocks, and for a resting place where none will scare them. And it shall no more be a fortress for Ephraim to flee to; nor

(s) Sion.
shall there be again a regal government in Damascus—ever hereafter, of the Syrians. For thou art not better than the children of Israel—than that which was their glory. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, there shall be in that day a diminution of the glory of Jacob; and the fatness of his glory shall be shaken;
5 and it shall be as when one gathereth the standing harvest and reapeth the ears of stalks; nay, it shall be as when one gathereth stalks in a sterile vale, still a stalk may be left in it:
6 or like the unripe berries of an olive tree, two or three may be left on the topmost bough, or four or five among the branches.
7 Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, in that day let man trust in his maker, and his eyes look to the Holy One of Israel:
8 and let him no more put confidence in altars, nor in the works of their hands which their fingers have made, nor look to the groves nor to their abominations.
9 In that day thy cities shall be forsaken, as the Amorites and Evites forsook theirs because of the sons of Israel: and they shall become a desolation.
10 Because thou hast forsaken God thy Saviour, and hast not been mindful of the Lord thy helper, therefore thou shalt plant a faithless plant and a faithless seed. On the day thou plantest thou shalt be deceived. Though thou sowest in the morning, shall it bloom for harvest? or on the day when thou shalt take possession, shalt thou as the father of man take possession for thy sons?
12 Alas! the multitude of many nations! Like the billowy sea so shall you be tossed, and the back of many nations shall sound like water. The multitude of nations being like a great flood, their flight shall be like that of a mighty torrent rolling on impetuously. For he will repulse them with scorn, and pursue them to a great distance, like chaff before the wind when men winnow, or as a tempest driveth the dust of a wheel.
14 Toward evening there will be grief; before morning they shall be no more. This is the portion of them who have plundered you; and this the inheritance of them, who have taken possession of you.

XVIII. Ah! wings of the land of ships! Thou who surpass- est the Ethiopian streams, thou who art sending pledges by sea, and paper messages on the water; for swift messengers
will go to a lofty nation, and to a strange and fierce people. There is one far transcending it. With regard to the nation without hope and trodden down, at this time, O all ye streams of that land, like an inhabited country, their country shall be inhabited. As if a signal were displayed from a mountain, as with the sound of a trumpet, let the news be spread. For thus hath the Lord said to me, "There shall be safety in this city of mine; like the light of noontide heat; and it shall be like a dewy cloud in a harvest day."

Before the vintage, when the blossom is perfect, and the young grape is swelling in the blossom; the diminutive bunches are to be cut off with pruning hooks, and the small shoots, to be nip'd off and cut away, and left together for the birds of the air, and for the wild beasts of the earth. And against them will be gathered all the birds of the air; and all the wild beasts of the earth will come upon it. At that time gifts will be brought to the Lord of Hosts from a people afflicted and peeled—even on account of a people great from this time and forever. A nation having hope, though trodden down, which is in a part of the river of its country, will send them to the place of him, whose name is the Lord of Hosts, even to mount Zion.

XI. A vision concerning Egypt.

BEHOLD the Lord is seated on a swift cloud; and he will come into Egypt; and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence; and the heart of the people shall melt within them.

And they shall be stirred up, Egyptians against Egyptians, and shall fight; brother against brother and neighbour against neighbour, city against city, and nome against nome. And the spirit of the Egyptians shall be troubled within them: and I will dissipate their counsel; and they will consult their gods and their idols; and them who cause a voice to proceed from the ground, namely the belly speakers. And I will deliver Egypt into the hands of men—cruel lords; and fierce kings shall have dominion over them.

Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, The Egyptians drink water even that near the sea, but the river shall fail and be dried up—both the streams and the canals of the river shall fail; and every collection of water shall be dried up, even every fen, where reeds
7 and papyrus grow. And all the quick springing herbage which is around the river, and every thing which is sown by the river shall be dried up and withered by the wind. And the fishermen shall mourn—all who cast drags in the river shall mourn; and they who spread nets and they who are anglers shall grieve: and shame shall seize them who work the split flax, and them who work up the cotton. They who are employed in such works shall be in sorrow; and they who brew beer shall mourn and be grieved in soul.

11 The princes of Tanis shall be fools, those wise counsellors of the king, their counsel shall be turned into folly. How can you say to the king, We are sons of wise men, sons of ancient kings? Where now are these wise men of thine? Let them tell thee publickly and declare what the Lord of hosts hath determined against Egypt.

13 The princes of Tanis have failed; and the princes of Memphis are exalted, and they will lead Egypt astray, tribe by tribe. For the Lord hath mingled for them a spirit of error, and they with all their works have made Egypt reel, as a drunkard doth, when he is vomiting. So that there shall be no work among the Egyptians, of which one can make head or tail, beginning or end. And in that day the Egyptians shall be like women in fear and trembling because of the hand of the Lord of Hosts which he will lay upon them.

17 And the country of the Jews will be a terror to the Egyptians: when any one shall mention it to them, they will be in terror, because of the counsel which the Lord of Hosts hath determined against it. In that day there shall be five cities in Egypt which shall speak the language of Chanaan. And swear by the name of the Lord of Hosts: and one of them shall be called the city of Asedek. And in that day there shall be an altar for the Lord in the country of the Egyptians, and at its boundary a pillar for the Lord, and it shall be an everlasting sign for the Lord, in the country of Egypt. Because they will cry to the Lord on account of their oppressors, therefore he will send them a man who will save them: he will vindicate their cause and deliver them. And the Lord will be made known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians will acknowledge the Lord
in that day, and offer sacrifices and make vows to the Lord and perform them. Thus will the Lord smite the Egyptians and heal them, and they shall be turned to the Lord, and he will hearken to them and heal them.

In that day this will be the highway from Egypt to Assyria; and Assyrians will come to Egypt and Egyptians to Assyria; and the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrians. In that day Israel shall be a third, among the Egyptians and among the Assyrians, blessed in the land which the Lord of Hosts hath blessed saying,
    "Blessed is my people which is in Egypt, and which is in Assyria and Israel which is mine inheritance."

IN the year that Tanathan having been sent by Arna king of Assyria went to Azotus and fought against it and took it, at that time the Lord spoke to Esaias son of Amos saying, "Go and take the sackcloth from thy loins and loose thy sandals from thy feet; and having done so walk stripp'd and bare foot." And the Lord said, As my servant Esaias hath walked stripp'd and bare foot, three years; three years he shall be for signs and wonders to the Egyptians, and Ethiopians, that in this manner the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, exposing to view the shame of Egypt. And they being subdued shall be ashamed of the Ethiopians in whom the Egyptians had placed confidence; for they were their glory. And in that day the inhabitants of this country will say,
    Behold we trusted to flee for help to them, who were unable to deliver themselves from the king of Assyria: how then shall we escape?

XXI. XIII. The vision of the Desert.
AS, when a whirlwind having passed through a desert, is rushing out of a desert, the sight from the land is terrible; this vision being also dreadful, was revealed to me. The treacherous dealeth treacherously; the transgressor transgresseth; the Elamites are upon me; and the elders of the Persians are coming against me. Am I now to groan and comfort myself?
3 For this cause my loins are filled with fainting; pangs have seized me like a woman in travail. I did wrong not to hear; I shuddered so that I could not see. My heart is bewildered, transgression overwhelmeth me. My soul is on the brink of despair. Prepare the table. Eat, drink ye chiefs. Having arisen prepare shields. Because thus the Lord said to me, "Go set a watchman for thyself and proclaim what thou seest." Thereupon I beheld a chariot with two riders, and a rider on an ass and a rider on a camel.

"Listen with the utmost attention, said the Lord, and call 'A fair breeze to the watch tower' I have kept my station all the day long, and by the camp I have stood the whole night; and behold here cometh a man riding in a chariot, and addressing me he said, 'It is fallen! Babylon is fallen! and all her images, and all the works of her hands are dashed on the ground.'"

Hear this ye who have been forsaken! and ye, who have been sorely grieved, hear what I have heard from the Lord of Hosts—what the God of Israel hath announced to us.

XIV. The vision concerning Idumea.

TO me one calleth from Seir, "Guard ye the fortifications," I keep watch morning and night. If thou wouldst inquire; inquire and dwell near me. Thou mayst go to rest in the western forest, or in the way to Dedan.

O inhabitants of the country of Thaiman, bring out water to meet the thirsty; meet with bread them who are fleeing, because of the multitude of the slain; and because of the multitude of dispersed; and because of the multitude of swords; and because of the multitude of bended bows; and because of the multitude of them who have fallen in battle. For thus hath the Lord said to me, "Within a year, according to the year of an hireling, the glory of the children of Kedar shall fail; and the remnant of the mighty bowmen of Kedar shall be small. For the Lord God of Israel hath spoken."

XXII. XV. The Oracle concerning the valley of Sion.

WHAT aileth thee, that you are all now gone up to the house tops? This vain city is full of people shouting. Thy slain are not slain with the sword; nor have thy dead died in
3 battle. All thy chiefs have fled and they who are taken are cruelly bound. Even the mighty men in thee have fled far away.

4 Therefore I said, Let me alone; let me weep bitterly: labour not to comfort me, for this distress of the daughter of my people. For it is a day of trouble and destruction and treading down. There is indeed some wandering from the Lord of Hosts; in the valley of Sion they are wandering about; from the least to the greatest they are wandering on the mountains.

6 But the Elamites have taken up their quivers; and the horsemen have mounted their horses; and the army is arrayed in order for battle; and on they will come. Thy choicest valleys shall be filled with chariots; and the horsemen will block up thy gates, and burst open the gates of Juda; and look, on that day, into the choicest houses of the city; and lay open the stores of the houses of David's citadel. They indeed know that they are many; and that the water of the old pool is turned into the city, and that the houses of Jerusalem have been pulled down, to fortify the wall in the city.

11 You have indeed provided water for yourselves, between the two walls nearer than the old pool, and have not looked to him who formed it of old, nor regarded him who created it.

12 Though the Lord of hosts, on that day, called for mourning, and lamentation, and for shaving of hair and girding with sackcloth, yet they indulged themselves in joy and gladness, slaying oxen and sacrificing sheep, that they might eat flesh and drink wine, saying, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die." Yes, these were their undisguised expressions, in the hearing of the Lord of hosts, therefore this sin will not be forgiven you till you die: Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Go to the treasury—to Somnas the steward, and say to him, Why art thou here? and what hast thou here? that thou hast hewn out for thyself a monument, and hast made for thyself a sepulchre on high, and graved for thyself a tabernacle in a rock?

17 Behold the Lord of hosts is now driving out and will utterly destroy men of rank, and he will take away thy robe and this gorgeous crown of thine, and whirl thee into a large immeasurable country, and there thou shalt die. And he will bring to disgrace thy splendid chariot, and make the house of thy chief a publick walk. And when thou shalt be removed from
20 thine office and station: it shall come to pass in that day, that
21 I will call my servant Eliakim son of Chelkias, and clothe him with thy robe. And this crown of thine I will confirm to him, and I will commit to his hands this office of thine: and he shall be as a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to them who dwell in Juda. And I will give him the glory of David, and he shall rule and there shall be no antagonist; and on his shoulder I will lay the key of the house of David; and he will open and none shall shut; and he will shut and none shall open: and I will make him a ruler in a sure place, and he shall be a throne of glory for the house of his father. And on him will rely with confidence, every honourable man in his father's house, from the least even to the greatest. On him they shall be dependant in that day.

25 Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, The man who is now fixed in a sure place shall be removed and taken away and shall fall; and the glory which is on him shall be utterly destroyed for the Lord hath spoken it.

XXIII. XVI. The Oracle concerning Tyre.

RAISE the mournful cry, O ships of Carthage, for Tyre is destroyed and there are no arrivals from the land of the Kittians. She is carried away captive.

2 Who could be compared with the dwellers in this island—these merchants of Phoenicia, who traversed the ocean—this offspring of merchants on many a water, who made a traffic of nations as of an ingathered harvest?

4 Be ashamed, O Sidon, said the sea—even the strength of the sea said,
    "I did not travail nor did I bring her forth; nor did I nourish her youths, nor educate her virgins; yet when the news shall reach Egypt, sorrow for Tyre will take hold on them."

6 Away to Carthage! Raise the mournful cry, ye who inhabit that isle! Was not she your boast of old, before she was delivered up?

8 "Who hath taken this counsel against the Tyrians? Is she inferior? Or hath she not power? Her merchants are glorious chiefs of the earth."
9 The Lord of Hosts hath determined to destroy all the haughtiness of the glorious; and to bring to contempt every thing glorious on the earth.

10 Work thy land: for ships no more arrive from Carthage, nor is thy hand which vexed kings, any more powerful by sea. The Lord of Hosts hath given a command, concerning Chanaan, to destroy its power: and shall it be said, You must not proceed to insult and distress the daughter of Sidon? Nay though thou shouldst go to the Kitians; yet even there thou shalt not have rest. Away to the land of the Chaldeans, though it hath been wasted by the Assyrians; because its walls had fallen.

14 Raise the mournful cry, O ships of Carthage, because your strong hold is destroyed.

15 And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forsaken seventy years, according to the days of a king, according to the time of a man. And it shall come to pass after seventy years, that Tyre shall be as the song of a harlot.

16 Take a kithara, stroll about, O city, O harlot long forgotten! Play skilfully; sing many songs, that thou mayst be remembered. And it shall come to pass after seventy years, that God will take account of Tyre, and she shall be restored to her former state, and be a mart for all the kingdoms of the world; which are on the face of the earth. And her traffick and gain shall be holy to the Lord. All her gain shall not be treasured up for themselves, but for them who dwell before the Lord, that they may eat and drink and be filled, and for contributions to be kept in remembrance before the Lord.

XXIV. XVII. Sect. 1. BEHOLD the Lord is about to destroy this inhabited land! He will lay it waste and uncover the face thereof and scatter abroad them who dwell therein. And it shall be as with the people so with the priest; as with the servant, so with the master; as with the maid, so with the mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the debtor, so with the creditor. With destruction the land will be destroyed, and with spoiling this land will be ransacked: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken this. The land mourned and this empire is de-
5 stroyed—the lofty people of the land mourned. As for the land, it transgressed by means of its inhabitants. Because they transgressed the law, and changed the institutions—the ever-lasting covenant, therefore a curse devoureth the land. Because they who dwell therein have sinned, therefore the inhabitants of the land shall be distressed, and few are the men who shall be left. The wine will mourn, the vineyard will mourn, and all that were merry-hearted will sigh. The mirth of the tabrets hath ceased, the sound of the kithara is no more.

9 They are confounded: they have drunk no wine. The palm wine was bitter to them who drank it. Every city is desolated—the houses will be shut up that none may enter.

11 Raise the mournful cry every where for the wine. A stop is put to all the joy of the land—all the joy of the land is gone.

12 The cities will be left desolate, and the houses being forsaken will be destroyed. All this shall come to pass in this land, in the midst of the nations. As when one shall shake an olive tree, so shall they be shaken: and when the vintage is over a shout will be raised.

14 But they who are left in the land shall be gladdened with the glory of the Lord. The water of the sea will be troubled: for this cause the glory of the Lord will be in the isles of the sea. In the isles of the sea the name of the Lord will be glorious.

16 (c)“O Lord the God of Israel! from the outskirts of the earth we have heard of thy wonders: there is hope for the righteous.”

(p)Let them say also, “Woe to the rebels who reject the law!

17 Terror and a pit and a snare are for you who dwell in the land: and it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the terror, shall fall into the pit; and he who getteth out of the pit, shall be caught by the snare. Because the flood gates of heaven are opened, therefore the foundations of the land shall be shaken.

19 With confusion the land will be confounded; with perplexity this land will be perplexed. It reeled to and fro like a drunkard when intoxicated: like a lodge in a vineyard the land shall be shaken. For iniquity hath prevailed over it; and it shall fall and shall not be able to rise. When God shall bring his hand on the hosts of heaven, even upon the kings of this land; and the congregation thereof shall have been assembled for imprisonment,
and shut up as chaff for many generations; of them there shall be a visitation.

23 (c) When the bricks shall have mouldered away, and the wall shall have fallen; because the Lord will commence his reign from Sion and from Jerusalem, and be glorified in the presence of the elders; O Lord God, thee I will glorify: in songs of praise I will extol thy name. For thou hast executed wonderful things; a counsel of old immutably true.

2 Because thou hast reduced cities to a heap of ruins—cities made strong, that their foundations might not fall; (a city of wicked men cannot be built to last forever) therefore the distressed people will bless thee and the cities of injured men will give thee thanks; for thou hast been the support of every humble city and the defence of them who were dispirited; by reason of their weakness. From wicked men thou wilt deliver them. Thou art the support of the thirsty and the breath of men in distress.

5 (p) When dispirited men shall be thirsting in Sion on account of wicked men to whom thou hast delivered us up; then will the Lord of Hosts make provision for all the nations.

7 On this mount they shall drink gladness: they shall drink wine and be anointed with myrrh on this mount. Hand down all these things to the nations for this counsel is for all the nations.

8 Mighty death had swallowed up; but the Lord God hath again wiped every tear from every face; and removed from the whole earth the reproach of this people. For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken.

9 And in that day they will say, "Behold our God in whom we trusted, will indeed save us. He is the Lord, for him we waited and exulted; let us therefore rejoice in our salvation. God will give rest on this mountain."

10 Sect. 2. WHEN the country of Moab shall be trodden down, as a threshing floor is trampled with cars and he shall cause his hands to relax, as he indeed humbled him to be slain, and shall humble his pride—those things on which he hath laid his hands, and shall lower the height of his wall of refuge; and it shall be laid low in the dust: in that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judea.
XXVI. (c.) "Behold we have a strong city! he will make salvation its wall and outworks. Open the gates; let the people enter, who keep righteousness and who keep truth; who support truth and keep peace; because their confidence is placed in thee, O Lord! who art to everlasting, the Mighty, the Eternal God, who hast humbled and brought down them who dwell in lofty places. Fortified cities thou canst demolish and level them with the dust, that the feet of the meek and lowly may trample them. The way of the pious was straight; the way of the pious was well prepared; for the way of the Lord is justice. We have trusted in thy name and in that remembrance which is the desire of our soul by night. To thee, O God, my spirit awaketh early, because thy statutes are a light on the earth. Learn righteousness ye dwellers on earth, for the wicked one is no more. Whoever will not learn justice on earth, cannot act agreeably to truth. Let the wicked be removed that he may not see the glory of the Lord. Thy hand, O Lord, was lifted high; but they did not know it; but when they know they will be ashamed. Zeal will seize an uninstructed people; even now a fire devoureth the adversaries.

O Lord, our God, grant us peace, for thou hast given us all things. O Lord, our God, take possession of us! besides thee, O Lord, we know none other. We celebrate thy name. As for those who are dead they would not see life, nor could physicians raise them up; therefore thou hast removed and destroyed and taken away all their males. Heap, O Lord, evils upon them—Heap evils on the vainglorious of the earth.

O Lord, in affliction I remembered thee. Thine instruction to us was with a small affliction; and as a woman in labour, when near delivery, crieth in her pangs, so have we been to thy beloved. On account of the fear of thee, O Lord, we conceived and suffered the pangs of child birth, and brought forth the spirit of thy salvation; for what we did in that land we are not to fall; but all the dwellers in that land are to fall.

(p)The dead shall be raised up again, even they in the tombs shall be raised up: and they in this land shall be filled with joy: for the dew from thee is healing for them; but the kind of the ungodly shall fall. Go my people, enter into thy
chambers; shut thy door: hide thyself for a little while; until 21 the anger of the Lord is passed. For behold the Lord from his sanctuary is about to bring wrath on the inhabitants of this land; and the land will disclose the blood on it, and will no longer cover the slain.

XXVII. In that day God will bring his holy sword, even his great and powerful sword, upon the dragon, the flying serpent—Upon the dragon, the crooked serpent; he will slay the dragon.

2 In that day the fair vineyard—I have a mind to lead a responsive song against this.

3 (c) I am a strong city, a city besieged.
(v) In vain shall I supply her with drink: for by night she will be taken, and by day she will fall. There is no wall, or it hath not availed her. Will any one set me to watch a stalk in a field? On account of this warfare I have rejected her.

5 (c) For this cause therefore the Lord hath executed all that he determined. I am about to be burned up.
(v) Let the inhabitants therein cry aloud, "Let us make peace with him. Let us make peace."

6 (p) They who are coming are children of Jacob. Israel shall bloom and blossom; and the world shall be filled with his fruit. He shall not, as he smote, be so smitten: nor, as he slew, shall he be so slain. Having fought and disgraced them he will let them go. Thou hast not been visiting with this severe wind, to destroy them utterly with a blast of anger.

9 (J) By means of this the iniquity of Jacob will be removed: and this will be to him a subject of thanksgiving, when I take away his sin—when they grind to powder all the hewn stones of their altars, and their groves no longer remain, and their idols hack’d to pieces like a forest are far away. The folded flock shall be disconsolate, like a flock which hath been forsaken; and for a long time the country shall be for a pasture, and flocks shall there take their rest. And after a time there will be no verdure in it, by reason of its being parched up.

(p) O ye women who are coming from a goddess attend! For this is not a people, who have understanding; therefore he

(c) the city. (v) the vineyard.
who made them will not have pity on them; nor will he who formed them shew them any favour.

(J) But it shall come to pass in that day, that God will hedge them about from the channel of the river even to Rinocorouron.

Therefore gather ye the sons of Israel together one by one. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be sounded and those shall come who are perishing in the land of Assyria, and they who are perishing in Egypt; and shall bow themselves down before the Lord, on this holy mountain in Jerusalem.

XXVIII. Sect. 3. (p) AH! the crown of haughtiness! The mercenaries of Ephraim! That flower which hath fallen from the glory on the top of the fertile mountain! Ye who are drunk without wine! Behold the wrath of the Lord is a harsh and terrible thing. Like a tempest of hail furiously driven when there is no shelter, like a mighty deluge sweeping a country.

In this land it will put a stop to the labour of hands; and with the feet shall be trampled down the crown of your pride, O mercenaries of Ephraim. And the flower which hath dropped from the hope of the Glory, on the top of the lofty mountain, shall be like the early fruit of a fig tree, which he who seeth it will wish to devour, before he can get it into his hand.

In that day the Lord of Hosts will be the crown of hope—the diadem of glory to the remnant of the people. They shall be left for the spirit of Justice—to administer justice and destroy the power of opposers. For by wine these were made transgressors; they were led astray by strong drink. Priest and prophet were stupefied with strong drink; they were gorged with wine—they were agitated by drunkenness; they reeled to and fro. This is oracling! A curse shall devour their counsel; for their counsel is for the sake of gain.

(f) "To whom, [say they] have we announced evils? And to whom have we announced a message—we who have been weaned from milk, we who have been withdrawn from the breasts? Expect affliction on affliction; hope on hope, yet a little while—yet a little while."

On account of the mockery of their lips—because they will speak to this people with a strange tongue, saying to them,

(f) The sententious speeches of the false prophets.
"This is the rest for him who is hungry; and this is the destruction, but they would not hear." Therefore the oracle of God will be to them "Affliction on affliction; hope on hope, yet a little while, yet a little while" that they may proceed on and fall backwards; and they shall be broken and snared and caught. Therefore hear the word of the Lord, ye afflicted men, and ye rulers of this people in Jerusalem! Because you said, "We have made a covenant with death; and with the grave we have made a treaty: though the furious tempest may pass through, it will by no means reach us. We have made falsehood our refuge and by this falschood we shall be saved."

Therefore thus saith the Sovereign Lord; behold I lay for the foundation of Sion a stone of inestimable worth—a chosen, precious corner-stone for the foundations of it, and he who believeth shall not be ashamed. And I will establish judgment for hope, and my mercy shall be for scales. But as for you who have vainly trusted in falschood, that the tempest would not reach you; and that it would not break your treaty with death; the hope which you have with respect to the grave shall not last: when the furious tempest cometh, by it you shall be beaten down. When it cometh it will overtake you. Early, very early in the morning it will come, and at night your hope will be wretched. Learn to hear, "We are straitened for room, we cannot fight. We are weakened by your pressing upon us." Like a mountain of wicked men the Lord will rise up; and he will be in the valley of Gabaon. With wrath he will execute his work—a work of bitterness; and his wrath will attack in a strange manner; and its severity will be unusual. As for you therefore, be not filled with joy, yet let not your bonds gather strength. For the things are complete and decisive which I have heard from the Lord of Hosts—which he will execute on all this land.

Listen and hear my voice; attend and hearken to these words of mine. Will the ploughman plough the whole day? Or prepare seed before he hath tilled the ground? Doth he not, when he hath levelled the face of the soil, then sow the small dill or cummin? and again sow wheat and barley and millet and rye in all thy borders? So thou shalt be corrected by the judgment of God; and be made glad. For the dill is
not cleaned with a corn drag; nor is the wheel of a wain to turn round on the cummin; but with a rod are beaten out the dill—and cummin.

(J) Yet with bread they will be eaten. For I, The I am will not be angry with you forever, nor shall the voice of my severity destroy you. These wonders have indeed proceeded from the Lord of Hosts.

XXIX. Hold consultation; exalt vain comfort. Ah city Ariel, against which David fought! collect provisions year after year; eat; for you shall eat with Moab; for I will bring distress upon Ariel, and her strength and her riches shall be for me. I will indeed encompass thee as David did; and surround thee with a rampire; and erect towers around thee. But when thy words shall be brought down to the ground; and shall be as if they sounded out of the earth; and thy voice on the ground shall be feeble; then shall the riches of the wicked be as the dust of a wheel, and the multitude of thine oppressors as chaff blown away: and this shall be as in a moment, suddenly. For from the Lord of Hosts there will be a visitation—a hurricane and a devouring flame of fire, with thunder and an earthquake and a mighty noise; and the wealth of all the nations which encamped against Ariel, and all they who are warring against Jerusalem, and all who have been assembled against her, and those distressing her, shall be like one dreaming dreams by night: and like men who in sleep are eating and drinking, but when they awake the dream is vain: even as a thirsty man dreameth that he drinketh, and when he waketh he is still athirst, his soul having trusted in a shadow: so shall be the wealth of all the nations, who have warred against mount Sion.—

(p) Be sunk in dejection and stand astonished; be drunk and reel, not with wine nor strong drink; for the Lord hath drenched you with a spirit of stupefaction, and will close up the eyes of them and of their prophets and their rulers. As for your seers of hidden things, all these prophesies will be to you like the words of a book which is sealed: which when they give to a man skilled in letters, saying, Read this: He will say, I cannot read it, for it is sealed. And should the book be pa
in the hands of an illiterate man, and they say to him, Read that, he will say, I do not know letters.

13 The Lord hath indeed said, (J) "This people draw near to me with their mouth; and with their lips they honour me; but their heart is far from me: and in vain do they worship me, teaching the commands and doctrines of men: therefore, behold, I will proceed to the removal of this people and I will remove them; and destroy the wisdom of the wise, and darken the understanding of the prudent." Alas! for them, who deeply form a design, but not by the Lord. Alas! for them, who form designs in secret, that their works may be in darkness; and who will say, "Who hath seen us, and who can find out us, or what we do?" Are not you to be considered as the potter's clay? Shall the thing formed say to the former of it, thou hast not made me. Or shall the work say to the workman thou hast not made me wisely? Is it not a little while, ere Libanus shall be changed to a likeness of mount Carmel? And Carmel be accounted a forest? And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of a book, and they in darkness, even they in thick darkness—the eyes even of the blind shall see; and the distressed shall exult with joy because of the Lord; and the disconsolate among men shall be filled with joy. The lawless one hath failed, and the haughty one is destroyed, and these are utterly cut off who maliciously commit iniquity, and who by reasoning cause men to err. But as for all them who reprove in the gates they will indeed lay a stumbling block, because of their having turned aside the righteous one for the unrighteous, therefore, thus saith the Lord respecting the house of Jacob, whom he set apart from Abraham; "Jacob will not be ashamed now, nor will he now change his countenance; but when his children shall see my works, because of me they will hallow my name. They will hallow the Holy One of Jacob, and tremble before the God of Israel. And they who have erred in spirit will gain knowledge, and the murmurers shall be taught obedience, and the trifling tongues will learn to speak peace."

XXX. Sect. 4. "AH rebellious children! saith the Lord, you have formed a design, but not by me: and thou hast
made covenants, but not by my spirit, that you may add sins to sins.

2 "They are setting out to go down to Egypt, without having consulted me—to be assisted by Pharao and protected by the Egyptians. For the protection of Pharao will be your shame, and a disgrace to them who have trusted in Egypt.

4 Because generals are unwelcome messengers at Tanis, they shall labour in vain with a people who will be of no service for assistance; but for a shame and disgrace.

6 This is the vision of the four footed beasts in the desert—A lion and a lion's whelp were in distress and difficulty; and from them went the asps and the brood of flying serpents, who carried their wealth on asses and camels to a nation which could not profit them.

7 In vain and to no purpose will the Egyptians help you. Announce to them, That this application of yours is vain.

8 Now therefore sit down and write these things in a tablet and make a book that they may be for the appointed time—even for the time to come. Because this is a rebellious people—lying children, who would not hear the law of God, who say to the prophets, "Preach not to us," and to them who see visions, "Speak not to us, nay, speak to us and tell us another error, and turn us from this way, and take from us this path, and take from us the oracle of Israel."

12 Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, because you have disbelieved these words and placed your hopes on a lie: and because thou hast murmured, and been confident in this matter; therefore this sin shall be to you like the tottering wall of a fortified city, which hath been taken by surprise; the fall of which is instantaneous. And its fall shall be like the breaking of an earthen vessel, the fragments of which are so small that there cannot be found among them a sherd on which thou canst carry fire or with which thou canst scoop up a little water.

15 Thus saith the Lord, Lord. The Holy One of Israel, when thou shalt return sighing, then thou shalt be saved, and thou shalt know in what a situation thou wast, when thou didst trust in these vanities.
16 Your strength was vain, yet you would not hearken, but said, "We will flee on horses." Therefore flee you shall. And, "We will mount swift coursers," therefore swift shall be your pursuers.

17 A thousand shall flee at the voice of one; and at the voice of five, many thousands shall flee: until you be left like a beacon on a mountain, and like a flag staff upon a hill.

18 (p) But again the Lord will wait to be gracious to you, and will therefore be exalted for compassionating you. Because the Lord your God is judge, happy are they who wait for him. Because a holy people will dwell in Sion, and Jerusalem with weeping cried, "Have mercy upon me." Therefore he will have mercy upon thee. When he heard the sound of thy cry, he hearkened to thee. When the Lord shall have given you bread of affliction and stinted water, they who lead thee astray shall no more come near thee. Because thine eyes will see them who are leading thee astray and thine ears will hear the words of the deceivers behind thee who say, This is the way let us walk in it, whether to the right or left; therefore thou wilt defile thine idols plated with silver, and cut to pieces those overlaid with gold, and scatter them like polluted water and cast them out as dirt. Then shall there be rain for the seed of thy land, and the bread of the increase of thy land shall be both abundant and nutritive: and thy cattle shall feed in rich and large pastures. Your bulls and your cattle which till the ground shall eat provender mixed with winnowed barley. And there shall be on every lofty mountain, and on every high hill streams of water in that day, when many shall be perishing and when towers may be falling. And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun; and the light of the sun shall on that day be seven fold; when the Lord will heal the bruises of his people, and when he will cure thy painful wound.

27 Behold the name of the Lord cometh for a time, a burning wrath. The oracle of his lips with glory is an oracle full of indignation, and the fury of the wrath devoureth like fire; and his breath is like a sweeping flood in a valley, which will reach up to the neck and swell to confound nations for their vain errors.
29 When error shall pursue them and overtake them, before their face ought not you to rejoice continually and continually go to my solemnities like them who are celebrating a festival? Like them who are gladdened you should go with instrumental music to the mount of the Lord, to the God of Israel. When the Lord shall cause the glory of his voice to be heard—when, to display the fury of his arm with wrath and indignation and consuming fire, he shall utter tremendous thunder, accompanied with a furious tempest of rain and hail. For by the voice of the Lord the Assyrians shall be beaten down by the stroke with which he will smite them.

32 This indeed he shall have from all around him—from every place whence they had a hope of that assistance on which he relied, they will with timbrels and the kithara fight against him, after his rout. Of thee he will previously demand (and hast thou not provided for his reign) a deep valley and wood laid up in piles; the wrath of the Lord will be fire and wood in abundance like a valley burning with brimstone.

XXXI. Sect. 5. ALAS! They went down to Egypt for help! They trusted in horses and chariots; for they have many and their cavalry is very numerous; and did not rely on the Holy

2 One of Israel, nor did they ask counsel of the Lord. Therefore he in his wisdom brought evils on them: and that his word may not be slighted, he will rise up against the houses of wicked men and against this hope of theirs which is vain—against an Egyptian—a man, not a god—against the flesh of horses in which there is no help. When the Lord shall lay his hand upon them, then shall these helpers fail and be all destroyed together. Because the Lord hath thus said to me,

"As the lion or the young lion will roar over the prey which he hath taken; and will repeat his roaring over it, until the mountains are filled with his voice, and the multitude are subdued and terrified at his wrath: so will the Lord of Hosts descend to encamp on this mountain—on this Sion—on the summits thereof: as birds hover over their young, so will the Lord of Hosts protect Jerusalem; he will hover over it and spring forward, and will protect and save it."

6 Therefore turn to him, O children of Israel, who are taking deep and wicked counsel.
7 Because men will in that day reject the works of their hands—their idols of silver and gold which their hands have made; therefore Assur shall fall—not by the sword of a man of valour, nor shall the sword of a mortal devour him; and he shall flee—(not from the face of the sword) and the young men shall be for destruction. For with a rock they shall be enclosed as with a rampart, and shall be subdued; and he who fleeth shall be taken.

Thus saith the Lord,
    'Happy he who hath a seed in Sion and a family in Jerusalem! For behold a righteous king shall reign and chiefs shall rule with justice. And this man will be one who hideth his words, and he will be hid as from a rolling flood. And he will be seen on Sion like a glorious stream in a thirsty land. And they shall no more put confidence in men; but shall apply their ears to hear. And the heart of the weak will listen attentively; and trifling tongues will soon learn to speak peace. And they will no more order the fool to govern, nor shall thy servants any more command silence. For the fool will speak foolishly, and his heart will devise vain things; that he may commit iniquity, and utter error before the Lord in order to scatter hungry souls: and the thirsty souls he will send away empty. For the counsel of the wicked will devise unlawful devices to destroy the poor with unjust pleas; and to baffle the pleas of the poor in judgment. But the pious have counselled with understanding; and their counsel shall be established.'

9 Sect. 6 (p) ARISE ye rich women and hear my voice, hearken to my words ye daughters of hope! make mention of a day of a year in sorrow, with hope. The vintage is destroyed; it hath failed! must it never come again any more?

11 Be confounded; be grieved, ye confident women! strip; make yourselves bare; gird your loins and beat your breasts, for the lovely field—for the fruitful vine. In this land of my people shall spring up the thorn and the briar, and joy shall be taken from every dwelling.

14 O rich city! O houses wholly forsaken! They shall abandon city, riches, lovely houses; and until the age the villages shall be dens—the joy of wild asses, the pastures of flocks, till a spirit come on you from on high. Then will a desert become a
16 Charmel and Charmel will be accounted a forest; and judgment will make a lasting abode in the desert, and righteousness will dwell in Charmel. And the works of righteousness shall be peace; and righteousness shall enjoy rest. As for them who have kept up their confidence till that age—his people shall then inhabit a city of peace and dwell secure, and they shall enjoy rest with riches. Though the hail descend, it shall not reach you: and they who dwell in the forest shall be secure as they in the plain.

(c) Happy they who sow on every water where the ox and the ass treadeth!

XXXIII. (p) Woe to them who miserably afflict you; but none can make you miserable. Even the deceiver doth not deceive you. The deceivers shall be taken and delivered up and like a moth on a garment they shall be crushed.

2 (c) O Lord, have mercy upon us! for in thee we have placed our trust. The seed of the rebellious were for destruction: but thou wast our safety in the time of trouble. At the terror of thy voice peoples were confounded; for fear of thee the nations were dispersed.

4 (p) Now your spoils are to be gathered; the spoils both of small and great. As if one were gathering locusts, so will they insult you.

5 (c) Holy is the God who dwelleth on high.
(p) Was Sion filled with judgment and justice?
6 (c) By law they were to be delivered up; in treasures is our safety.
(p) Let there be there wisdom and knowledge and piety towards the Lord, (These are the treasures of righteousness;) then behold with the dread of you they shall be terrified—they, of whom you have been afraid, will for fear of you raise a grievous cry. Messengers will be sent weeping bitterly, suing for peace. For their highways shall be deserted, the dread of the nations is at an end and the treaty with them broken. And you will account them common men.

9 The land mourned; Lebanon was ashamed; Saron was become fens; Galilee and Charmel were bare.

10 "Now will I arise, saith the Lord, now shall I be glorified; now shall I be exalted; now you shall see: now you shall feel."
The strength of your spirit shall be vain; a fire shall utterly devour you; and nations shall be burned up, as thorns in a field are rejected and burned. The far distant nations shall hear what I have done, they who are near shall know my power. The transgressors in Sion are fled; terror will seize the ungodly. Who will tell you that a fire is kindled? who will proclaim to you the place which is everlasting? He who is walking in righteousness, speaking of a straight way; who hateth iniquity and injustice; who shaketh his hands from bribes; who stoppeth his ears that he may not hear a bloody sentence; who shutteth his eyes against the appearance of injustice: he shall dwell in a lofty cavern of a strong rock: bread shall be given him and his water shall not fail.

(p) You shall see a king with glory; your eyes shall see a far distant land; your soul will meditate on terror. Where are the scribes? Where the counsellors? Where is he who numbereth them who are fed—the people small and great? Alas! they gave no counsel; nor did they understand him whose voice was so low that a despised people could not hear, and he who heareth hath not knowledge.

(c) Behold the city Sion is our salvation. Thine eyes will look upon Jerusalem. It is a rich city composed of tents which should not be shaken; nor should the pins of her tabernacle ever be moved, nor its cords broken.

(p) Because the name of the Lord is great to you, it shall be to you a place of streams and canals broad and spacious.

(c) Thou shalt not pass this way; nor shall a galley with oars cross; for my God is great and will not pass me by. The Lord our judge—the Lord our chief—the Lord our king—the Lord will himself save us.

(p) Thy tackling broke, for they had no strength, thy mast gave way. It will not support the sails, nor rear a standard until it be delivered up for a spoil; therefore many who are lame will seize the prey: but let not the people who dwell among these say, "I am wearied out" for their sin is forgiven them.
2 the people who are therein. Because the wrath of the Lord is against all the nations, and his anger against this number of them to destroy them and deliver them up to slaughter; therefore their wounded and dead shall be cast out, and the stench of them shall ascend; and the mountains shall be drenched with their blood; and all the powers of the heavens shall waste away; and the heaven shall be rolled up like a scroll and all the stars shall fall like leaves from a vine and as leaves fall from a fig tree.

5 (J) My sword hath drunk deep in the heaven; behold it shall come down on Idumea and on the people justly doomed to destruction.

6 (p) The sword of the Lord hath been glutted with blood; it is pampered with suet—with the blood of he-goats and lambs, and with the suet of goats and rams. Because there is a sacrifice for the Lord in Bosor, and a great slaughter in Idumea; therefore the fatlings shall fall with them, namely the rams and the bulls. And the land shall be drenched with blood, and glutted with their suet. For it is the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year for a judicial retribution to Sion: and its torrents shall be turned into pitch, and its land into sulphur. And its land shall be like pitch burning day and night, and which shall not be extinguished: for a long time the smoke of it shall ascend. During its generation it shall be desolate. And for a long period fowls and porcupines, ibises and crows shall dwell therein. And over it shall be stretched a line of devastation; and in it the onocentaurs shall dwell. The chiefs of it shall be no more; for its kings and its nobles shall be for destruction. And in their cities shall spring up bracken; and brambles shall be its fortresses: and they shall be cots for Sirens, and for the ostrich's court. And demons shall meet onocentaurs; and bellow one to the other. Onocentaurs shall there enjoy repose having found for themselves a place of rest. There the porcupine hath made its nest; and the land hath safely kept its young. There the deer have assembled and seen each other's face. I counted them and there is not one of them lost. They have not had occasion to seek each other: for the Lord hath issued orders to them; and his spirit hath brought them together. And he will himself cast the lots
for them, his hand hath meted the place for them to feed.—For a long time you shall inherit it.

(c) For generations of generations let them rest therein.
XXXV. Rejoice, O desert; shout for joy, O thirsty desert, 2 and blossom like a lilly. Let the deserts of Jordan also bloom and rejoice; to it hath been given the glory of Lebanon and the honour of Charmel. And my people shall see the glory of the Lord, and the majesty of our God.
3 Be strong ye hands which are feeble, and ye knees which 4 are without strength. Take comfort ye who are faint hearted; take courage, be not terrified; behold our God retributeth judgment; he will indeed make retribution—he himself will 5 come and save us. Then shall be opened the eyes of the 6 blind; and the ears of the deaf will hear. Then will the lame bound like a hart; and the stammering tongue will speak plain.
Because water is burst forth in the desert, and torrents in 7 a thirsty land; therefore the glowing sand shall become pools, and for the thirsty soil there will be fountains of water. The 8 reedy beds and the pools there will be the joy of birds. There will be there a pure highway, which shall be called The Holy way. And the unclean shall not come there; nor shall there be there an unclean way. But as for the dispersed, they shall 9 travel it, and shall not be led astray. No lion shall be there; nor shall any ravenous beast come up thither, nor ever be found there; but in it the redeemed will walk, and they who have been collected for the Lord. They indeed shall return and come to Sion with joy, and everlasting joy shall crown their head: for on their heads will be praise and rapture; and gladness shall have full possession of them. Pain and sorrow and sighing are fled.

XXXVI. IN the fourteenth year of the reign of Ezekias, Sennacherim king of the Assyrians came up against the fortified 2 cities of Judea, and took them. And the king of the Assyrians sent Rabsakes from Lakes to Jerusalem, to king Ezekias, with a great army. And he halted at the canal of the upper 3 pool in the high way to the fuller's field. And to him went out Eliakim the son of Chelkias the steward, and Somnas the 4 scribe, and Joach son of Asaph the recorder. And Rabsakes.
said to them, Tell Ezekias, Thus saith the great king; the king of the Assyrians, On what hast thou placed confidence? Notwithstanding negociation and fair speeches, are not preparations making for war? Now therefore on whom hast thou relied, that thou rebellest against me? Behold thy reliance is on that staff—that staff of reed—that broken reed, Egypt; on which if a man lean, it will pierce his hand and go through it. Such is Pharao king of Egypt to all who rely on him. But if you say, "Our confidence is in the Lord our God;" were you now in close connexion with my master the king of the Assyrians; and were I to give you two thousand horses; could you put riders on them? How then can you revolt and affect to be petty princes. Those are reduced to slavery who have trusted in the Egyptians for charioteers and cavalry. Besides, are we now come up without the Lord against this land to war against it? The Lord hath said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.

Then Eliakim and Somnas and Joach said to him, Speak to thy servants in Syriac, for we understand it. Therefore speak not to us in the Jewish language. Why speakest thou to the ears of the men on the walls?

Thereupon Rabsakes said to them, Hath my lord sent me to your lord or to you to speak these words? Was it not to those men—to them who are stationed on that wall, that they may eat dung and drink urine, both they and you together?

Then Rabsakes stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language and said, Hear the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians, Thus saith the king, Let not Ezekias deceive you with speeches. He cannot deliver you. And let not Ezekias say to you, God will deliver you; and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians. Hearken not to Ezekias. Thus saith the king of the Assyrians, If you wish to be happy, come out to me; and eat, every one, of his own vine and his own fig trees, and drink water from your own cisterns, until I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of corn and wine, and of bread and vineyards. Let not Ezekias deceive you saying, God will deliver you. Have the gods of the nations, delivered every one his own country out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians?
19 Where is the God of Emath and Arphath? And where is the God of the city Eppharuim? Were they able to deliver Samaria out of my hand? Who is there of all the gods of the nations who hath delivered his country out of my hand, that God should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? But they were silent and none answered him a word, because the king had given a charge that none should answer.

22 Then Eliakim the son of Chelkias the steward, and Somnas the secretary at war and Joach the son of Asaph the recorder went to Ezekias with their clothes rent and told him the words of Rabsakes. And when Ezekias heard them he rent his clothes and put on sackcloth and went up to the house of the Lord. And he sent Eliakim the steward and Somnas the scribe and the elders of the priests clothed with sackcloth to Esaias son of Amos the prophet with this message to him, Thus saith Ezekias, "This day is a day of trouble and of reproach and of rebuke and of wrath; for pangs are come on a woman in travail and she hath not strength to bring forth. That the Lord thy God may attend to the message of Rabsakes which the king of the Assyrians hath sent to reproach the Living God; and refute the words which the Lord thy God hath heard, thou shouldst pray to the Lord for these poor remains." So when the servants of king Ezekias came to Esaias he said to them, "Thus shall you say to your lord, Thus saith the Lord, Be not terrified at the words which thou hast heard; with which the messengers of the king of the Assyrians have reproached me. Behold I am about to put such a spirit in him, that he having heard news will return to his own country: and he shall fall by the sword in his own land."

8 So Rabsakes returned and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna, for he heard that he had removed from Lachis; and Thoraka king of the Ethiopians came out to give him battle. Upon hearing this, he retreated, and sent messengers to Ezekias, saying, Thus shall you say to Ezekias king of Judea, Let not thy God, on whom thou reliest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians. Hast thou not heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done? How they have destroyed all the land? And shalt thou be delivered? Have the gods of the na-
tions delivered them whom my ancestors destroyed? Either, Goza or Charran or Raphath which are in the country of Theemath? Where are the kings of Emath? And where those of Arphath? And where those of the city Eppharuim, of Anagougana?

14 When Ezekias received the letter from the messengers and had read it, he went up to the house of the Lord; and having spread it before the Lord, Ezekias prayed to the Lord, saying, "O Lord of Hosts the God of Israel, who art enthroned on the cherubim! Thou alone art the God of every kingdom of the world. Thou hast made the heaven and the earth. Incline, O Lord, thine ear! O Lord, hearken! Open, O Lord, thine eyes! O Lord, look down and behold the words of Sennacherim which he hath sent to reproach the Living God. In truth, O Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste this whole inhabited land and the country of those [here mentioned] and have cast their idols into the fire; for they were not gods; but works of mens' hands, stocks and stones; therefore they destroyed them. But now, O Lord, our God, save us out of their hands that every kingdom of the earth may know, that thou alone art God." Thereupon Esaias son of Amos was sent to Ezekias and said to him, Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, "I have heard the prayer which thou hast made to me concerning Sennacherim king of the Assyrians. This is the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning him,

22 "The virgin daughter of Sion hath despised thee and mocked thee; at thee the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head; whom hast thou reproached and provoked? or against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, (without lifting up thine eye to the Holy One of Israel?) That by thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord? For thou hast said, By the multitude of my chariots, I have ascended the height of mountains, and to the utmost limits of Libanus, and cut down the lofty cedar and beautiful cypress, and entered the stately part of the forest. I have laid bridges and dried up waters and every collection of water." "Hast thou not heard those things of old which I have done? From ancient times I gave command and have now pointed out to lay waste nations in strong
27 places and them who dwell in fortified cities. I weakened their hands and they were dried up, and became like dry grass on house tops, and like a blasted ear of corn. And now I know thy resting place and thy going out and thy coming in. As the rage with which thou hast been inflamed, and thy bitterness are come up to me; I will therefore put a hook in thy nose and a bridle in thy jaws; and turn thee back by the way in which thou camest."

31 Now this shall be a sign to thee. Eat this year what thou hast sown, and in the second year what is left; but in the third year sow ye and reap; plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof; for they who are left shall continue in Judea. They shall strike root downwards and bear fruit upwards. For they of Jerusalem shall be left and they of mount Sion shall be saved. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will do this. Therefore thus saith the Lord, With regard to the king of the Assyrians, he shall not enter this city; nor shoot an arrow against it; nor present against it a shield; nor enclose it with a rampire. But by the way which he came, by the same he shall return; and into this city he shall not come. Thus saith the Lord, I will cover this city with my shield to save it for mine own sake and the sake of my servant David.

36 So an angel of the Lord went forth and slew of the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand. And when they arose in the morning they found all these dead bodies. Thereupon Sennacherim king of the Assyrians retreated and went and dwelt in Ninive. And as he was worshipping, in his house, Nasarach his ancestor; Adramelech and Sarousar his sons smote him with their swords; and, they having made their escape to Armenia, Asardan his son reigned in his stead.

XXXVIII. At that time Ezekias was seized with a mortal sickness; and Esaias son of Amos, the prophet, came to him and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Give orders respecting thy household, for thou art at the point of death and shall not live. Thereupon Ezekias turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, saying, "O Lord, remember how I have walked before thee with truth and with an upright heart, and have done the things which are pleasing in thy sight." And Ezekias wept bitterly. And a word of the Lord came to Esaias saying, Go and say to Ezekias, Thus saith the Lord, the
God of thy father David, I have heard thy prayer and seen thy tears, Behold I will add to thy term fifteen years. And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians and cover this city with my shield. And this shall be a sign to thee from the Lord, that God will perform this decree. Behold I will bring back the shadow of the steps the ten steps of the house of thy father, which the sun hath gone down. I will bring back the sun those ten steps. So the sun re-ascended the ten steps which the shadow had gone down.

9 The prayer of Ezekias, king of Judea, when he had been sick, and was recovered from his sickness.

10 I said in the height of my days I shall go down to the gates of Hades, I shall leave the years which remain. I said, I shall no more see the salvation of God in the land of the living; I shall no more see the salvation of Israel on the earth; I shall behold man no more. I am cut off from my generation, I have left the remainder of my life. He is gone and departed from me, like one striking a tent, having just pitched it. My soul within me was like a web which the weaver was in act to sever from the loom.

13 In that day I was delivered up until morning as to a lion. So did he break to pieces all my bones. For from day to night I was delivered up. Like a swallow so let me twitter; and like a turtle dove so let me moan; for mine eyes were too weak to look up to the vault of heaven—to the Lord who hath rescued me and taken from me the sorrow of my soul. Of this indeed thou, O Lord, wast told, and thou hast restored my breath and I am comforted and live. For thou hast rescued my soul that it should not perish; and hast cast behind thee all my sins. For those in the mansion of the dead cannot praise thee; nor can the dead return thee thanks, nor they in Hades hope for thy kindness. The living will praise thee even as I do; for from this day I shall raise up children, who will proclaim this lovingkindness of thine, O God of my salvation; and I will never cease praising thee with a psaltery, all the days of my life over against the house of God.

21 Now Esaias had said to Ezekias, Take a cake of figs and bruise and apply it as a poultice and thou shalt recover. Whereupon Ezekias said, Let this be a sign to Ezekias, that I shall go up to the house of God.
XXXIX. AT the time when Marodach Baladan the son of Baladan the king of Babylon sent letters and ambassadors and presents to Ezekias (for he heard that he had been sick unto death and had recovered:) and Ezekias was rejoiced at their arrival and shewed them the house of Nechotha and that of the silver and of the gold; and that for stacte, and for perfumes and for myrrh; and all the treasure houses and all that he had in his treasuries; there being nothing in his house nor in all his dominion which Ezekias did not shew them; Esaias the prophet then went to king Ezekias and said to him, What say those men? And, whence are they come to thee? And Ezekias said, They are come to me from a far distant land, from Babylon. And Esaias said, What have they seen in thy house? To which Ezekias replied, They have seen all that are in my house. There is nothing in my house which they have not seen: nay, they have seen also what are in my treasuries. Thereupon Esaias said to him, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts! Behold days are coming, when they shall seize all that are in thy house. And all that thy fathers have collected even to this day shall go to Babylon; and nothing shall be left behind. Moreover God hath said, That of thy children whom thou shalt beget, they will take some and make them eunuchs in the house of the king of the Babylonians. And Ezekias said to Esaias, Good is the word of the Lord which he spake: let there be, I pray, peace and righteousness in my days.

XL. Sec. 1 COMFORT ye, comfort ye my people, saith God: O priests, speak to the understanding of Jerusalem; comfort her; for her humiliation is accomplished; her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received from the hand of the Lord [blessings] double to the punishment of her sins.

A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight the roads for our God. Let every valley be filled up, and every mountain and hill be levelled: and let all the crooked be made a straight road, and the rough way, smooth plains: and the glory of the Lord will appear: And all flesh shall see the salvation of God. For the Lord hath spoken.

“A voice of one saying, Proclaim.” Wherefore I said, What shall I proclaim? “All flesh is grass; and all the glory of
8 man as a flower of grass. The grass is withered and the flower fallen; but the word of our God will endure forever."
9 Ascend a lofty mountain, thou who proclaimest good news to Sion: exalt thy voice with strength, thou who bringest glad tidings to Jerusalem: raise it up; be not afraid; say to the cities of Juda, Behold, your God! behold the Lord! The Lord is coming with majesty; and his arm with dominion. Behold his reward is with him; and his work, before him. Like a shepherd he will tend his flock; and with his arm he will gather the lambs, and comfort the ewes that are with young.
12 Who hath measured the water with his hand, and the heaven with a span and the whole earth with a hand breadth? Who hath weighed the mountains in scales and the dales with a balance? Who hath known the mind of the Lord? and who hath been of his counsel to teach him? or whom hath he consulted that he might instruct him? or who hath pointed out judgment to him? or who hath shewn him the way of knowledge? If all the nations are as a drop from a cask; and are accounted as the turning of a balance—may be reckoned as spittle; if Lebanon is not sufficient for a fire, nor all the beasts sufficient for an holocaust offering: and all the nations are as nothing and reckoned as nothing: to whom have you likened the Lord? and to what likeness have you compared him? Hath a carpenter when he hath made an image, or the goldsmith when he hath melted gold and gilded it, prepared this as a likeness of him? for the carpenter chuseth a sound piece of timber and will inquire wisely, how he may place his image that it may not be moved.
21 Will you not know? will you not hear? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have you not known the foundations of the earth? He it is, who occupieth the circuit of the earth; and the inhabitants thereon are as grasshoppers. He it is, who established the heaven as an arch, and spread it out as a tent to be dwelt in; who giveth chiefs as a nothingness to govern: and hath made the earth as a mere nothing. For they could not plant nor could they sow, nor could their root strike into the ground; he blew upon them and they withered, and a whirlwind will sweep them away like stubble.
25 Now therefore to whom have you likened me; that I may be exalted? said the Holy One. Raise your eyes upwards and
take a view: who hath displayed all those? He who bringeth out his host by number can call them all by name. On the account of abundant glory, by reason of the mightiness of his power he hath in no wise escaped thy notice; wherefore, thou, Jacob, shouldst not say, yet what hast thou, O Israel, spoken? "My way is hidden from God" and, "My God hath put off my cause and is gone." Hast thou then not known? hast thou not heard? The everlasting God, the God who fitted up the ends of the earth, cannot hunger, nor can he be weary; nor can his understanding be searched out. He it is who giveth strength to the hungry and grief to them who have not had sorrow. For youths will hunger and young men be weary, and chosen warriors will become strengthless; but they who wait upon God shall have new strength; they shall put forth fresh feathers like eagles; they shall run and not be wearied; they shall march on and shall not faint.

XLI. (J) Dedicate yourselves to me, O Islands, for the Archons will gather new strength. Let them draw near and confer together, then let them announce judgment.

2 Who raised up righteousness from the East—called upon it to attend his steps? when he marcheth on, he will exhibit it before nations and confound kings and dash their swords to the ground, and their bows shall be driven away like stubble.

3 When he pursueth them, the road for his feet shall pass through to peace. Who hath performed and done these things? He who called that righteousness—who from the generations of the beginning is calling it—I God the First, and to the succeeding ages, THE I AM.

5 The nations saw and were affrighted; the ends of the earth drew near and came together. Every one is determining to help his neighbour and his brother, and one will say, The carpenter had strength, so had the smith who beateth with a hammer and plateth it. Sometimes indeed one will say, "It is a beautiful composition?" These things they made strong with nails; they will fix them up that they may not be moved: but thou Israel my servant; thou Jacob, whom I have chosen; thou seed of Abraham whom I loved! have I not taken thee from the ends of the earth, and from the speculations thereof called thee, and said to thee, Thou art my servant I have cho-
10 sen thee and have not forsaken thee. Fear not, for I am with thee; be not led astray, for I am thy God. I have strengthened thee and helped thee, and secured thee with my just right hand. Behold all thine adversaries shall be ashamed and confounded; for they shall be as nothing and all thine opponents shall be destroyed. Thou mayst seek but thou shalt not find the men, who through drunkenness will dare to insult thee. For they shall be as mere nothing: and they who war against thee shall be no more. For I am thy God, who have hold of thy right hand, and who say to thee, Fear not, O Jacob, O diminutive Israel! I have helped thee, saith thy God, who redeemeth thee, O Israel. Behold I have made thee like the wheels of a wain bruising to pieces a brood of pigeons: thou indeed shalt grind mountains and reduce hills to small pieces, and make them like dust: and thou shalt winnow them; and a wind shall take them up, and a whirlwind shall sweep them away; but thou shalt be gladdened in the sanctuaries of Israel; and the poor and the needy shall exult with joy: for when they shall seek water and there shall be none, and their tongue is parched with thirst; I the Lord their God, I the God of Israel will hear and will not forsake them; but will open rivers on the mountains, and fountains in the midst of plains: I will turn the wilderness into watery fens, and with streams refresh the thirsty ground. And I will plant in the dry wilderness the cedar and box, the myrtle and cypress and elm: that they may see and know, and consider and understand at once that the hand of the Lord hath done these things; even what the Holy One of Israel hath pointed out.

21 The trial of you is near, saith the Lord God; your councils are nigh at hand, saith the king of Jacob; let them draw near and tell you what will happen, or such things as these before they come to pass. Tell us that we may apply our understanding, and that we may know the final issue, and the train of events leading to it. Tell us, announce to us the things in successive train to the issue; and we will acknowledge that you are gods. Confer favours and inflict punishments, and we will pay respect and see at once, that wherever you are thence is your operation.
They have chosen you an abomination from the earth; but I have raised up that one from the north, and that other from the risings of the sun; they shall be called by my name: let the Archons come, and as the clay of a potter—even as a potter treadeth clay so shall you be trampled down. Who now can tell these things from the beginning, that we may know, even these things before hand: that we may say, The prediction is true. There is none who predicteth, nor doth any one hear your words. I will first give notice to Sion and I will comfort Jerusalem on the way. For of the nations behold there is none, and of the idols none giveth warning. And should I ask them, Whence are you? They could not make me any answer. For are these they who made you? They are indeed those who vainly lead you astray.

XLII. Sect. 2. (J) JACOB is my servant, I will uphold him, Israel is my chosen one, my soul hath embraced him; I have put my spirit upon him; he will publish judgment to the nations. He will not scream, nor urge with vehemence: nor will his voice be heard abroad in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break, nor extinguish a dimly burning taper; but will publish judgment to establish truth. He will shine out, and shall not be broken until he hath established judgment on the earth. In his name therefore let the nations trust.

Thus saith the Lord, the God who made the heaven and fixed it; who established the earth and the things therein and who giveth vital air to the people on it, and breath to them who tread thereon; I the Lord God have called thee for saving mercy, and I will take hold of thy hand and strengthen thee; for I have given thee for the covenant of a race—for the light of nations: to open the eyes of the blind; to lead out from chains them who are bound, and out of prison, them who are sitting in darkness. I am the Lord God; this is my name: this glory of mine I will not give to another, nor these powers of mine to the graven idols. With regard to the former predictions, behold they are come to pass; and these are new things which I now declare; and before their promulgation, they are revealed to you.
(p) Sing to the Lord a new song, ye, his government! praise his name, ye from the utmost border of the earth, ye who go down on the sea and navigate it, ye islands, and ye who dwell therein. Let the desert be glad and the villages thereof; the folds for flocks and them who inhabit Kedar: let the inhabitants of Petra rejoice; let them shout from the top of the mountains: to this God let them ascribe glory; let them proclaim his powers among the isles. The Lord God of Hosts will come forth and tread down battle; he will rouse up his zeal, and shout against his enemies with majesty.

(J) I have been silent; but shall I always keep silence and forbear? Like a woman in travail I have endured suffering; I will strike with astonishment and wither at once. I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all the herbage on them. I will make rivers islands and dry up pools, and lead the blind in a way which they know not, and cause them to walk in paths which they have not known. For them I will make the darkness light, and the crooked ways a straight road. These things I will do, and I will not forsake them: but as for them they have turned backwards! be whelmed in shame, ye who trust in graven images—who say to the molten images, ye are our gods.

(p) Hear, O ye deaf; and ye blind, look up that you may see.

(J) Who indeed is blind but my servants? And deaf, but those who rule over them? Even the servants of God are become blind. You have seen again and again but have not regarded: your ears have been opened, but you did not hear.

(p) The Lord God came to a determination, that he might be justified and might magnify praise. Whereupon I beheld and the people were plundered and dispersed: for the snare was every where in the private chambers, and in the houses also where they had hidden themselves. They were for a prey and there was no rescuer—for a spoil; and there was none who said, Restore. Who is there among you who will give ear to these things? Attend to those leading causes; for which he hath given Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to them who plung-
dered him. Hath not God, against whom they sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, and whose law they would not obey—hath not he brought upon them his fierce anger?
(J) Though war prevailed over them, and they who were burning them up were all around, yet they did not, any of them, know, nor lay it to heart. Still however thus saith the Lord, the God who made thee O Jacob, and who formed thee, O Israel! fear not. Because I have redeemed thee—have called thee by thy name—thou art mine; therefore when thou passest through water, I am with thee, and the streams shall not overwhelm thee: and when thou passest through fire, thou shalt not be burned up—the flame shall not quite consume thee.
Because I the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel am thy Saviour, I have given Egypt for thy ransom and Ethiopia and Soena in thy stead. Because thou hast been precious in my sight—hast been honoured and I loved thee; therefore I will give men for thee and chiefs for thy life. Fear not. Because I am with thee, from the east I will bring thy seed, and gather thee together from the west: I will say to the north, "Give up" and to the south, "Keep thou not back; bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth—all that are called by my name." For I have prepared him for my glory, I have fashioned him and made him, and have brought out a blind people: for their eyes are as if they were blind; and they are deaf, though they have ears.
(p) All the nations were assembled together; now let all the archons be assembled: can any among them announce these things? Or can any tell you these things before hand? Let them produce their witnesses and be justified, and let them hear and tell things true.
(J) Be you witnesses for me: and as for me I myself am a witness saith the Lord God; and this servant of mine whom I have chosen; that you may know and believe and understand that with respect to me, The I am, There is no other God before me; and after me none will exist. I am God and there is no Saviour besides me. I have announced and saved; I reproached when there was no strange god among you. You are witnesses for me; and I the Lord am still the same God.
from the beginning; and there is none who can rescue out of my hands. I will act; and who can prevent it—Thus saith the Lord, the God who redeemed you, the Holy One of Israel; For your sakes I will send to Babylon, and rouse up all who are fleeing; and the Chaldeans shall be bound in ships. I am the Lord God, your Holy One, who pointed out Israel your king.

Thus saith the Lord who made a highway in a sea, and a path in the mighty water; who brought out chariots and horses and a mighty host, but they lay down to sleep and shall rise no more: they were extinguished like an extinguished taper. Mention not these former things, nor reason from the things of old. Behold I am in act to do new things, which shall now spring up and you shall know them—I will make a way in the wilderness, and streams of water in the desert. The wild beasts of the field will bless me—the Seirens and the daughters of the ostrich; because I have given water in the wilderness, and flowing streams in the desert, to give drink to this race of mine which I have chosen—my people whom I have preserved to recount my praises.

I had not now called upon thee, Jacob, nor caused thee, Israel, to weary thyself: thou hadst not brought me thy sheep of thy whole burnt offering; nor honoured me with thine incense offerings: I had not burdened thee with sacrifices of flour; nor wearied thee with demands of frankincense: nor hadst thou purchased with silver perfumes for me; nor had I desired the suet of thy sacrifices: but thou stoodest before me in thy sins and in thine iniquities. I even I, THE I AM, am he who blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake; and of thy sins I will no more make mention: but do thou mention them and let us be judged; do thou first state thy transgressions, that thou mayst be acquitted.

Your fathers first, then your chiefs transgressed against me. When the chiefs polluted my sanctuary, then I gave up Jacob to be destroyed, and Israel to reproach. But now, hear, O Jacob my servant, and thou Israel, whom I have chosen; Thus saith the Lord, the God who made thee, and who formed thee from the womb, still thou shalt be helped. Fear not, thou my servant Jacob, and thou, beloved Israel, whom
3 I have chosen: for I will give water in their thirst to them who are travelling in a desert. I will put my spirit on thy seed, and my blessings on thy children; and they shall spring up like grass among water, and like a willow by the side of a flowing stream. One will say, "I belong to God;" and another will call himself by the name of Jacob; and another will write on his hand, "I belong to God," and will surname himself by the name of Israel.

6 Sect. 3. THUS saith God, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, the God of Hosts, I am the first and I am the last: besides me there is no God. Who is like me? Let him stand up and call and announce, and make ready for me: In as much as I have made a man for this age, let them now tell you the train of events before they come to pass. Hide not yourselves nor be led astray. Have you not heard from the beginning? And have I not told you? You are witnesses whether there be any God besides me. And have not then the fashioners and engravers heard? They are all fools making things to please their fancies—things which cannot profit them: but shame shall cover these god makers, and all the engravers of these useless things. When all by whom they were made are dried up; then let all the stupid among men be collected and stand together, and let them be confounded and ashamed together: for the carpenter sharpened an axe, with a hatchet he modelled it; then he put it into a lathe and with his strong arm fashioned it. Though he be hungry and faint, he must not drink water.

13 The carpenters having chosen a piece of wood framed it by rule and glued the parts together, and made it in the form of a man and with the comeliness of a man, to set it in a house. He cut wood from the forest which the Lord planted—a pine tree, which the rain had nourished, that it might be fuel for the use of man: and having taken some of it he warmed himself; and with other pieces they made a fire and baked cakes, and of the residue they made gods and worshipped them. Did he not burn half of it in the fire, and, with the coals of that half, bake cakes; and having roasted meat with it did he not eat and was satisfied; and when warmed say, "Aha! I am warmed, I .
17 have enjoyed the fire?" Yet of the residue he made a carved god, and worshippeth it, and prayeth to it, saying, "Deliver me, for thou art my God."

18 They had not sense to think; for they were so involved in darkness that they could not see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts: nor did any reason in his mind, nor by his understanding recollect, that he had burned half of it in the fire, and on the coals thereof baked cakes, and had roasted flesh and eaten, and of the residue had made an abomination; so they bow themselves down to it. Know thou that their heart is ashes, and they are led astray and none can deliver his soul. Take a view of it, will you not say, "There is indeed a lie in my right hand?"

21 Remember these things, O Jacob, even thou Israel, for thou art my servant. I have made thee my servant; therefore

22 O Israel do not thou forget me. For, lo! I have made thy transgressions vanish like a cloud—and thy sins like the murky vapour. Return to me and I will redeem thee.

23 (c) Rejoice, O heavens! because God hath compassionated Israel. Utter sounds of joy, ye foundations of the earth! Burst forth into songs, ye mountains and hills, and all ye trees which are thereon! Because God hath redeemed Jacob and Israel shall be glorified.

24 Sect. 4. (J) THUS saith the Lord, who redeemed thee—even He who formed thee from the womb; I am the Lord the Maker of all things; I alone stretched out the heavens and firmly established the earth. Who else can dispel from the heart the signs of belly speakers and divinations? I am he who turneth sages backwards and maketh their counsel foolish; but establisheth the word of his servant, and verifieth the counsel of his messengers—who saith to Jerusalem, "Thou shalt be inhabited;" and to the cities of Idumea, "Ye shall be re-builted, and in its deserts vegetation shall spring up:" Who saith to the deep, Thou shalt be wasted, and I will dry up the rivers: who saith, to Cyrus [I will give] wisdom, and he shall execute all my pleasure. Who saith to Jerusalem, "Thou
shalt be rebuilded and the house dedicated to me I will found.

XLV. Thus saith the Lord God, For mine anointed, for Cyrus, (whose right hand I have taken hold of that nations may listen before him) I will break the power of kings; I will open gates before him, and cities shall not be shut up. I will go before thee and level mountains; I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and burst asunder the bars of iron; and give thee treasures of darkness—deep, hidden, unseen treasures I will disclose to thee, that thou mayst know, that I, the Lord thy God, who calleth thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.

4 For the sake of my servant Jacob, and of Israel my chosen one, I will call thee by thy name and receive thee kindly.

5 As for thee, thou didst not know me. Because I am the Lord God and there is no God else besides me; I strengthened thee when thou didst not know me; that they from the risings of the sun and they from its goings down may know, that there is no God besides me. I the Lord am God and there is none else.

7 It was I who provided light and made darkness; who make peace and create evils: I the Lord God am he who doth all these things.

8 (c) Let the heaven above be glad; and the clouds shower down righteousness. Let the earth spring and bloom with mercy and let it cause righteousness to spring up with it.

9 (J) I the Lord am he who created thee. Is any thing endowed with excellence? I fashioned it like the clay of a potter. Will the ploughman plough the ground all the day long? Will the clay say to the potter, "What art thou making? Or the work to the workman, "Thou hast not hands." Will the thing formed reply against him who formed it? Will one say to his father, What wilt thou beget? Or to his mother, What art thou bringing forth? Wherefore thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, even he who made the train of events; Do you question me concerning my children; and concerning the works of my hands give me directions! It was I who made the earth and man on it: it was I who with my hand established the heaven: it was I who gave direction to all the stars. It is I who have raised him up with righteousness to be king; and all his ways shall be straight. He shall rebuild this city of mine, and send back the captives of this my people, not for ransom nor reward, said the Lord of Hosts.
14 Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, That for which Egypt laboured and the traffic of the Ethiopians, and the Sabeans men of tall stature shall come over to thee; and they shall be thy vassals and shall follow thee bound with chains. They will come over to thee and pay thee homage and pray to thee because God is in thee.

15 (c) There is indeed no God besides thee. For thou art God and we knew it. The God of Israel is a Saviour: let all that oppose him be shamed and confounded and in shame let them march along.

17 (J) Dedicate yourselves to me, ye islands! The Lord hath saved Israel with an everlasting salvation. They shall not be put to shame nor confounded any more forever. Thus saith the Lord who made the heaven, the same God who displayed the earth to view, and who, having made it, parcelled it out: he did not make it to be waste, but formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord and there is none else. I have not spoken in secret nor in an obscure part of the earth. I have not said to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye a vain thing. I am THE I AM, the Lord, who speak righteousness and proclaim truth. Assemble yourselves together and come; consult together ye who escape from among the nations. They are devoid of knowledge, who carry the wood—their carved image; and who pray to gods which cannot save them. If they will proclaim, let them draw near and know at once, who hath published these things from the beginning: then let them be announced to you. I am God and there is no other besides me; a just God and a saviour besides me there is none. Turn to me and ye shall be saved, ye from the farthest part of the earth, I am God and there is none else. By myself I swear (righteousness shall proceed from my mouth; my words shall not be reversed) that to me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear, with respect to God, saying, Righteousness and glory shall come to him, and all that make distinctions among them shall be ashamed. On account of the Lord they shall be acquitted; and in God all the seed of Israel will glory.

XLVI. Sect. 5. BEL is fallen; Nabo is broken to pieces. Their graven images were a load for wild beasts and cattle.
You are carrying them bound like a burden on the weary,
2 fainty, and hungry, who are all without strength and unable to escape from battle; and as for them, they are carried away captives!
3 Hearken to me O house of Jacob and all ye remnant of Israel, who have been carried from the womb, and instructed
4 from childhood to old age; I am the self existent, even till you grow old, I am, I sustain you: I made you and I will bear with
5 you; I will lift you up and I will save you. To what have you
6 likened me? Look! Contrive, ye wanderers! Collecting gold from a bag, and silver by weight they will put it in a balance; and having hired a goldsmith they made handiworks and
7 bowing themselves down they will worship them. They carry it on the shoulder and move on; but if they set it in its place, there it remaineth. It cannot move itself. And if any one cry to it, it cannot hear, nor can it save him from evils.
8 Remember these things and groan; reform, ye who have
9 been led astray: return with the heart and remember the things
10 of old, that I am God and there is none besides me, who can declare events before they happen, as if they were already accomplished. When I have spoken, all my counsel shall stand;
11 and all that I have determined, I will effect. Calling from the east a winged fowl, even from a far distant land, for purposes which I have resolved on, I have spoken and brought, I have created and made, I have brought it and made its way prosperous.
12 Hear me, ye who have lost understanding—who are far
13 from righteousness! I have brought my saving mercy near; and the salvation which is from me I will not delay. I have placed in Sion salvation for Israel, for a subject of glory.
XLVII. Come down, sit on the ground, O virgin daughter of Babylon! Sit on the ground, O daughter of the Chaldeans! for
2 thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate! Take a millstone and grind corn. Doff thy veil; uncover thy grey locks.
3 Make bare thy leg: wade through rivers. Thy shame shall be exposed; thy nakedness shall be seen.
4 This vengeance I will take on thy account and no more deliver thee up to men. Thy deliverer is the Lord of Hosts, his name is the Holy One of Israel.
5 Sit in compunction: enter into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans! thou shalt no more be called the strength of a kingdom. I was angry with my people: thou didst pollute my heritage, I delivered them into thy hand: and thou didst shew them no mercy. The yoke of the aged thou madest very heavy, and saidst, I shall be empress forever. These things did not enter thy heart; nor didst thou call to mind what might at last befal thee. Now, therefore, hear these things, thou voluptuary! thou who art seated at ease, who thinkest thyself secure; who sayest in thy heart; "I am and there is none else. I shall not sit a widow, nor shall I know the loss of children."

9 But now upon thee shall come these two things, suddenly, in one day. The loss of children and widowhood shall come suddenly on thee, in the midst of thy sorcery, in the full strength of thy mighty enchantments. Confiding in thy wickedness thou indeed saidst; "I am and there is none else." Know thou, the consciousness of these things and thy whoredom shall be thy shame.

11 Thou indeed saidst in thy heart, "I am and there is none else;" but upon thee shall come destruction, and thou shalt not know—a pit; and into it thou shalt fall. Yes, upon thee shall come misery, of which thou shalt not be able to rid thyself: and destruction shall come upon thee suddenly of which thou wilt have no apprehension. Persist now in thine incantations and in thy manifold sorcery, which thou hast learned from thy youth: if thou canst be benefited by them. Thou hast wearied thyself with thy counsels: let the astrologers now stand up and save thee—let them who gaze on the stars tell thee what is instantly coming upon thee. Behold like brambles on a fire they shall all be burned up; and shall not deliver their own life from the flame. Seeing thou hast coals of fire, sit upon them; will they give thee relief? Thou hast wearied thyself with this traffic from thy youth. The men have wandered away, every one to his own home; but for thee there shall be no safety.

XLVIII. Hear these things, ye house of Jacob, ye who are called by the name of Israel! ye who are descendants of Juda! ye who swear by the name of the Lord God of Israel, making mention of it, but not with truth, nor with righteousness; and who stay themselves on the name of this holy city, and rely for support on the God of Israel, whose name is the Lord of Hosts.
I have already told you former things: when they proceeded from my mouth and were published, I did them speedily and they came to pass. I know that thou art of an untractable temper, that thy neck is a sinew of iron and thy brow, brass; therefore I told thee beforehand what would come upon thee; I published them that thou mightest not say, "The idols have done this to me," nor say, "The graven or molten images have ordered it for me," you have heard all these things, and did not yourselves know them. But now I have made thee hear new things, which shall hereafter come to pass. Yet hast thou not said, "Things done now and not formerly!" Yes, never in former days didst thou hear these things. Thou shouldst not say, "Indeed I know them." Thou didst neither know nor didst thou believe, nor did I from the beginning open thine ear: for I knew that, being in rebellion, thou wilt continue to rebel and wilt still be called a transgressor from the womb.

For mine own name's sake I will shew thee my wrath, and bring upon thee my marvellous things; that I may not cut thee off utterly. Behold I sold thee; but not for money; and I have rescued thee out of the furnace of affliction. For mine own sake I will deal with thee; because my name hath been profaned, and my glory I will not give to another.

Hearken to me, O Jacob! and thou Israel whom I call. I am the first and am forever. My hand hath founded the earth, and my right hand hath established the heaven. Let me summon them and let them stand together. Let them all be assembled and listen. Who hath told them these things? I who love thee have executed thy will on Babylon, to take away the seed of the Chaldeans. I have spoken, I have called, I have brought him, and have made his way prosperous. Draw near to me and hear these things: from the beginning I have not spoken in secret. When it was doing I was there. And now the Lord, Lord hath sent me and his spirit.

Thus saith the Lord who hath redeemed thee, the Holy One of Israel, I am thy God. I pointed out to thee, how to find the way in which thou shouldst walk. And hadst thou hearkened to my commandments thy peace would have been like a river and thy righteousness like a wave of the sea; and thy seed would have been as the sand, and the issue of thy bowels as
the dust of the ground. Still however thou shalt not be utterly cut off; nor shall thy name perish from before me. Haste out of Babylon! flee from the Chaldeans: proclaim the joyful news: and let this be published. Proclaim even to the end of the earth—Say "The Lord hath delivered his servant Jacob; and if they shall thirst (for he will lead them through a desert) a rock shall be cleft and water shall gush forth, that my people may drink." There is no peace, saith the Lord, for the wicked.

XLIX. Sect. 6. (M) HEARKEN to me, O isles; and ye nations attend! (After a long time one will stand up saith the Lord.)

From my mother's womb he mentioned my name and made my mouth like a sharp sword and hid me under the cover of his hand. He made me like a chosen shaft, and in his quiver kept me concealed, and said to me, "Thou Israel art my servant, and by thee I shall be glorified." Whereupon I said, I have laboured in vain; for vanity and for nought I have spent my strength; therefore my cause is with the Lord; and my labour is before my God. And now thus saith the Lord who formed me from the womb. To be his servant to gather Jacob to him, and Israel. I shall be gathered and glorified before the Lord. And my God will be my strength. Moreover he said to me, Is it a great thing for thee to be called my servant to re-establish the tribes of Jacob and bring back the dispersion of Israel? Behold I have given thee for the covenant of a race—for the light of nations; that thou mayst be for salvation to the farthest part of the earth.

Thus saith the Lord who delivered thee—the God of Israel, "Hallow him who despised his life, him who was abhorred by the nations, the slaves of the Archons. Kings shall see him and chiefs shall rise up and they shall worship him for the sake of the Lord; because the Holy One of Israel is faithful, therefore I have chosen thee.

Thus saith the Lord, "In an acceptable time I have hearkened to thee, and in a day of salvation helped thee; and have formed thee and given thee for the covenant of nations that thou mayst reduce the earth to order and possess desolate he-
9 ritages, saying to them who are in bonds, Go forth; and to them who are in darkness, "Come into light." In all the highways they shall be fed, and there shall be pasture for them in all the paths. They shall not hunger nor shall they thirst, nor shall the burning wind nor the sun smite them; but he who hath compassion on them will comfort them and lead them to bursting springs of water. And I will make every mountain a highway, and every path a pasture for them. Behold they from afar shall come, some from the north and the west and others from the land of the Persians."

13 (c) Rejoice O heavens; and let the earth be glad, let the mountains resound with bursts of joy; for God hath compassionated his people, and comforted those of his people who were afflicted.

14 (M) Hath Sion then said, "The Lord hath quite forsaken me," and, "Why hath the Lord forgotten me?" can a woman forget her child? or not have compassion on the offspring of her womb? Grant that a woman may forget even these, but I will not forget thee, said the Lord. Behold I have engraven thy walls on my hands; and thou art continually before me.

17 And thou shalt be speedily rebuilt by them who destroyed thee; and they who laid thee waste shall become thine offspring. Look up with thine eyes all around and view them all; behold they are gathered together and coming to thee. As I live saith the Lord, Thou shalt clothe thyself with them all, as with raiment, and wrap them about thee as a bride doth her dress. Because thy waste and desolate and ruined places will now be too narrow for the inhabitants, and they who devoured thee shall be removed far from thee; therefore thy sons whom thou hast lost will say in thine ears, This place is too strait for me: make room for me, where I may dwell. Whereupon thou wilt say in thy heart, Who hath begotten these for me? I indeed was childless, and a widow, Who then hath brought up these for me? I was abandoned and alone; whence then have I these?

22 Thus saith the Lord, Lord, Behold I will lift up my hand to the nations, and I will erect my standard for the isles. And they shall bring thy sons in their bosoms and carry thy daughters on their shoulders: and kings shall be thy foster fathers; and their queens thy nursing mothers. And on the face of the
ground they shall pay thee homage, and lick the dust of thy feet. And thou shalt know that I am the Lord, and that they who wait for me shall not be ashamed.

24 (a) Can any one take spoils from a giant?
    (b) And if any one captivate unjustly shall he be safe.

25 For thus saith the Lord, When one captivateth a giant he shall take spoils.
    (a) But can one take from a mighty man and be safe?
    (b) But it is I who vindicateth thy cause, and I will deliver thy children. And they who afflicted thee shall eat their own flesh, and drink like new wine their own blood and be made drunk; and all flesh shall know that it is I the Lord who delivered thee. And who uphold the strength of Israel.

L. Thus saith the Lord, Of what sort was the bill of your mother's divorce with which I divorced her? Or to what creditor have I sold you? Behold you were sold for your transgressions; and for your iniquities I divorced your mother.

2 Why, when I came, was there no man? And why, when I called, did none answer? Is my hand unable to save? Or have I no power to rescue? Behold with my rebuke I can dry up the sea, and make the rivers a desert, so that the fishes thereof shall shrivel for want of water, and die for thirst. I can clothe the heaven with darkness, and make its covering like sack-cloth.

4 The Lord Lord giveth me an instructed tongue, to know when it is proper to speak a word. He gave it me in the morning; he gave me in addition an ear to hear. And the instruction of the Lord, Lord openeth mine ears and I am not rebellious, nor do I gainsay. My back I have given to scourges, and my cheeks to be slapped with an open hand, and I turned not my face from the shame of spittles. Indeed the Lord Lord was my helper; therefore I was not ashamed, but kept my countenance firm as a rock. I knew indeed that I should not be confounded, because he who justified me is near at hand.

8 Who is he that contendeth with me? Let him stand up with me face to face. Yes, let my accuser, whoever he be, come near me. Behold the Lord, Lord will be my advocate; who can do

(a) An objection stated.   (b) The answer.
me any evil? Behold you shall all wax old like a mantle, and the moth shall consume you.

10 Who is there among you who feareth the Lord, let him hearken to the voice of his servant. Ye who walk in darkness and have no light, trust in the name of the Lord and stay yourselves on God. Behold you are all kindling a fire and increasing the flame; walk in the light of your fire and by the flame which you have kindled. On my account these things have befallen you. You shall lie down in sorrow.

LI. Hearken to me ye who are in pursuit of righteousness and who are seeking the Lord. Look at that hard rock which you have been hewing, and into that deep pit which you have digged. Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who brought you forth. For he was an individual when I called him; and I blessed him and loved him and multiplied him. And now O Sion, I will comfort thee. I have indeed comforted all her desolations, and I will make her waste places like a garden; and those west of her like the garden of the Lord. In her shall be found joy and gladness, thanksgiving and the sound of praise.

4 Hear me; hear me, O my people, and ye kings; listen to me; for from me shall proceed a law; and my judgment shall be for the light of nations. My deliverance is approaching speedily, and my salvation shall go forth as light; and on mine arm nations will rely. The islands will expect me and on mine arm they will rely. Turn up your eyes to heaven; then look down on the earth below! for the heaven is like smoke condensed, and the earth shall grow old like a garment, and like those things the inhabitants shall perish: but my salvation shall endure forever, and my saving mercy shall never fail.

7 Hearken to me, ye who know judgment; ye people, in whose heart is my law. Fear not the reproach of men, nor be overcome by their contempt. For they are like a garment which shall be worn out by time, and like woollens which shall be devoured by a moth; but my saving mercy shall endure forever, and my salvation to generations of generations.

9 Awake, awake, O Jerusalem! and clothe thyself with the strength of thine arm. Awake as at the beginning of day.

10 Art thou not as the generation of old, which dried up the sea—the swelling water of the deep? Which made the depths of the sea a road for the delivered and redeemed to pass? For
under the guidance of the Lord they shall be brought back, and shall come to Sion with joy and everlasting gladness; for praise shall crown their head and joy shall overtake them. Grief and sorrow and sighing are fled.

12 I THE I AM am he who comforteth thee. Recollect what thou wast when terrified at a mortal man, and at a son of man
13 who are withered like grass; and forgottest the God who made thee—him who made the heaven and founded the earth; and wast every day in continual dread of the furious countenance of thine oppressor. For how did he consult to carry thee away!
14 But where now is the fury of thine oppressor? For when thou
15 art saved he shall not stand; nor long continue. Because I thy God am he who tempesteth the sea and causeth the billows
16 thereof to roar; the Lord of Hosts is my name; I will put my words in thy mouth, and cover thee under the shelter of my hand with which I made the heaven and founded the earth; and say to Sion, Thou art my people.
17 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem who hast drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of his indignation. For thou hast drunk the cup of horror—the great cup of his wrath; and
18 drained it. And of all thy children which thou didst bring forth there was not one who comforted thee, nor was there one who took hold of thy hand: no, not of all the sons whom thou
19 didst raise. Because these things have befallen thee, who will condole with thee? Desolation and destruction, famine and the
20 sword; who will comfort thee? Thy sons? Some are astounded; some asleep at the head of every way, like a parboiled beet; Some are full of the indignation of the Lord, enervated by the
21 Lord God. Therefore hear, thou, who hast been humbled, and
22 who art drunk, but not with wine. Thus saith the Lord, the God who judgeth his people, Behold I have taken out of thy hand the cup of horror—the great cup of mine indignation; and
23 thou shalt no more drink it again. And I will put it into the hands of them, who have injured thee and oppressed thee—who have said to thy soul, Crouch down that we may walk over thee, when thou hadst bent thy body down level with the earth in the street, to them passing along.

LII. Sect. 7. AWAKE, awake, O Sion! clothe thyself, O Sion, with thy strength. Put on thy glory, O Jerusalem, thou
holy city! No more shall the uncircumcised and the unclean pass through thee. Shake off the dust, and stand up: assume thy seat, O Jerusalem! Loose the chain from thy neck, O captive daughter of Sion! For thus saith the Lord, You were sold for nought; and you shall be ransomed, not with money.

Thus saith the Lord, My people went down to Egypt at first to sojourn there; and to the Assyrians they were carried by force. Now therefore why are you here? Thus saith the Lord, Because my people were taken away for nought, (express your amaze; and raise the mournful cry!)

Thus saith the Lord, On your account my name is continually reviled among the nations. Therefore in that day my people shall know my name. Because I THE I AM, the same who am speaking, am at hand, like beauty on the mountains—like the feet of one proclaiming peace, like one proclaiming glad tidings. Because I will cause thy salvation to be proclaimed, Saying, O Sion, thy God will reign; because the voice of thy watchmen is lifted up; with the voice therefore let all at the same time express joy.

(c) Because eyes will look to eyes when the Lord compassionateth Sion; let the ruins of Jerusalem break out together with bursts of joy. Because the Lord hath compassionated her and delivered Jerusalem; let the Lord therefore make bare his holy arm in the sight of all the nations! and let all the ends of the earth see the salvation come from our God.

(J) Depart, depart; come out thence, and touch no polluted thing. Come out from the midst of her; be clean, ye who carry the vessels of the Lord. For you shall not come out in haste, nor by flight march along; for the Lord will march before you in front; and the God of Israel will bring up your rear.

Behold my servant will mind and be exalted and highly glorified. In the same manner as many will be astonished at thee; (so devoid of glory for men will be thine appearance and thy glory for the sons of men) so many nations will express admiration at him; and kings will shut their mouths, because they, to whom no publication was made concerning him, shall see; and they, who had not heard, will understand.
LIII. (c) O Lord, who hath believed this report of ours, and 2 to whom hath the arm of the Lord been made manifest? We have made proclamation as a child before him: as a root in a thirsty soil, he hath no appearance nor glory. We have seen 3 him; and he hath neither appearance nor beauty: but his appearance is mean and defective beyond the sons of men. Being a man in affliction and acquainted with grief, because his countenance was dejected, he was despised and disesteemed. 4 This man beareth away our sins; and for us he is in sorrow: And we considered him as being in trouble and under a stroke and in affliction. But he was wounded for our sins, and afflicted for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon 6 him; by his bruises we are healed. We all like sheep had strayed; every man wandered in his way: and the Lord delivered him up for our sins: and he, on the account of his affliction, openeth not his mouth. He was led as a sheep to be slaughtered. And as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so he 8 openeth not his mouth. In this humiliation his legal trial was taken away. Who will declare his manner of life.

(J) Because his life is taken from the earth—for the transgressions of my people he is led to death; therefore for his funeral I will give up the wicked, and the rich for his death. Because he committed no iniquity, nor practised guile with his mouth, and the Lord determineth to purify him from this stroke: when his soul shall be given up for a sin offering; of you he shall see a seed which shall prolong their days. Moreover it is the determination of the Lord to remove him from the trouble of his soul—to shew him light and fashion him for knowledge—to justify the Righteous One who is serving many well, when he shall bear away their sins; therefore he shall inherit many and divide the spoils of the strong.

(p) Because his soul was delivered up to death and he was numbered among transgressors and bore away the sins of many and on the account of their iniquities was delivered up;

LIV. rejoice thou barren, who bearest not—break forth with shouts of joy, thou who suffertest not the pangs of child birth; for many more are the children of the desolate than of her who 2 hath a husband. For the Lord said, Enlarge the place of thy tent and thy curtains; fix up; spare not; lengthen thy cords
3 and make thy stakes strong. Extend still farther to the right and left. And thy seed shall inherit nations and thou shalt inhabit wasted cities. Be not terrified because thou hast been exposed to shame; nor blush because thou hast been reproached. For thou shalt forget the shame of ancient times, and the reproach of thy widowhood thou shalt remember no more.

5 For the Lord who is thy maker, whose name is the Lord of Hosts—even he who delivered thee, shall be called the God of Israel, in the whole earth.

6 The Lord hath not called thee as a wise forsaken and disconsolate; nor as a wife that hath been hated from her youth.

7 Thy God hath said, "I left thee for a little while; but with great mercy I will compassionate thee: in a short wrath I turned away my face from thee; but with everlasting kindness I will have mercy on thee." The Lord who delivered thee hath said, "From the flood which was in Noah's time this is my purpose—as I solemnly promised him at that time that I would no more be angry with the earth on thine account, nor in rebuking thee overturn the mountains; and that thy hills should no more be moved; so my kindness for thee shall not fail, nor shall the covenant of thy peace ever be changed: for he said for thee, Be appeased, O Lord."

11 (J) O thou afflicted and storm beaten! art thou not comforted? Behold I am preparing for thee carbuncles for thy building stones, and the sapphire for thy foundations; and for thy battlements I will lay jasper; and crystal, for thy gates; and for thy circumambient walls, precious stones: even thy sons, all instructed of God; and thy children in great prosperity. And with righteousness thou shalt be rebuilded. Abstain from injustice and thou shalt not be affrighted; and as for terror, it shall not approach thee. Behold proselytes shall come to thee for my sake; and they shall sojourn with thee and fly to thee. Behold I have created thee, not like a coppersmith blowing coals and using a tool for the work. But I have created thee, not for destruction. Perish every weapon formed against thee! I will not prosper it. Though every voice should rise up against thee for judgment, thou shalt overcome them all and in the trial they shall be condemned. There is an inheritance for them who serve the Lord, therefore you are to be just for me, saith the Lord.
LV. Sect. 8. HO! ye who are thirsting, come to water! and ye who have no money, come buy and eat, without money and without price, wine and the choicest bread. Why are you expending money and labour for that which will not satisfy? Hearken to me and you shall eat good things; and your soul will be regaled with delicacies. Incline your ears and follow in my paths; hearken to me and your soul shall live on good things; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant—the gracious promises to David which are faithful.

Behold for a testimony to nations I gave him, a chief and a lawgiver to nations. Nations which knew thee not will fly to thee, for the sake of the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.

Seek ye the Lord; and when you find him call upon him.

And when he draweth near to you; let the wicked man forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his counsels, and turn to the Lord and he shall find mercy; for he will abundantly pardon your sins. For my counsels are not as your counsels; nor are my ways as your ways, saith the Lord. But distant as the heaven is from the earth, so is my way distant from your ways; and your thoughts from my understanding. For as the rain when it descendeth, or snow, from the heavens, doth not return thither, till it hath watered the earth, and caused it to generate and bloom and yield seed for the sower and bread for food; so shall it be with my word: when it hath proceeded from my mouth, it shall not be reversed, till all are accomplished which I willed; and till I prosper thy ways and my commandments. For with gladness you shall go forth; and with joyfulness you shall be taught: for the mountains and hills shall leap for joy, expecting you; and all the trees of the field will clap with their branches. And instead of the briar, shall spring up the cypress; and instead of the thistle, shall come up the myrtle. And the Lord shall be for a name, and for an everlasting sign which shall not fail.

LVI. Thus saith the Lord, Keep judgment and practise righteousness; for my salvation is near, just ready to come, and my saving kindness to be revealed. Happy the man who doth these things and the mortal who adhereth to them; and who
is careful not to profane my sabbaths, and who restraineth his hands from doing evil.

3 Let not the stranger who cleaveth to the Lord say, "The Lord will separate me from his people." Nor let the eunuch say, "I am a dry tree." For thus saith the Lord to the eunuchs, Whoever of them shall keep my sabbaths, and chuse the things in which I delight and adhere to my covenant; I will give them, in my house and within my walls, an honourable place better than sons and daughters—I will give them an everlasting name which shall not fail. And with regard to the strangers who cleave to the Lord to serve him, and love the name of the Lord—to be his man servants and maid servants, even all who are careful not to profane my sabbaths and who adhere to my covenant; them I will bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings, and their sacrifices shall be acceptable on mine altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations.

8 Sect. 9. THE LORD who gathereth the dispersed of Israel said, Because I will gather a congregation for him, O all ye beasts of the field come! O all ye beasts of the forests, devour! you see that they are all blind; that they have not knowledge. They are dumb dogs, they cannot bark: they are asleep in bed, they love to slumber: yet these dogs are of untamed appetite; they can never have enough. They are indeed mischievous, they have no consideration. They all followed their own courses, every one according to his own purpose. You see how a righteous one was destroyed, and no one layeth it to heart. And righteous men are taken away, and no one observeth, that on account of iniquity the righteous one was taken away. His sepulture shall be in peace. He is taken from among you.

3 But as for you, draw near hither, ye lawless sons! ye seed of adulterers and of fornication! in what have you indulged yourselves? and at whom have you opened your mouth, and at whom lolled your tongue? are you not children of destruction—a lawless race? invoking idols under shady trees, slaying your children in the valleys among the rocks? This shall be
thy portion—this thy lot—as thou hast poured out libations to them and to them offered up sacrifices, shall I not for these things be incensed? On a high and lofty mountain thou hast made thy bed, and caused thy sacrifice to ascend thither; and behind the posts of thy door thou hast set up thy memorial. Didst thou think, that, if thou departedst from me, thou shouldst have something more? Thou hast loved them who lay with thee and multiplied thy fornication with them, and hast done it with many who are far from thee; and hast sent ambassadors beyond thy borders; and humbled thyself even to Hades; With thy long journies thou hast wearied thyself and hast not said, I will take some rest. Because in thy full strength thou hast done this; therefore thou shouldst not supplicate me.

Of whom hast thou been so anxiously afraid that thou hast dealt falsely with me, and hast not remembered nor taken me into thy thoughts, nor into thy heart? When I saw and neglected thee thou didst not fear me. Now I will declare my righteousness and thine evil deeds which shall not avail thee. When thou criest; let them deliver thee in thine affliction. A wind indeed shall overtake them all; and a whirlwind shall sweep them away. But they who adhere to me shall possess the land, and inherit my holy mountain. And they will say, Clear the ways before him, remove obstructions out of the road of my people.

Thus saith the Most High, who on high inhabiteth eternity, who is Holy among holies; whose name is THE MOST HIGH; who at rest in the holics giveth patience to the humble, and life to them who are of a contrite heart; I will not contend with you forever, nor will I be continually angry with you, for from me spirit is to proceed and I have made every breathing soul. Because of sin I grieved him a little while and smote him and turned away my face from him; and he was grieved and went his ways sorrowing; I have seen his ways and healed him, and comforted him, and given him true consolation; peace upon peace to them near and to them far off. So the Lord said, I will heal them. But the wicked shall be tossed like waves and shall not be able to rest. There is no peace, said God, to the wicked.
LVIII. Sect. 10. (J) CRY aloud and spare not: raise thy voice like a trumpet: proclaim to my people their sins, and to the house of Jacob their iniquities. Day after day they seek me, and desire to know my ways; like a people who have practised righteousness, and who have not forsaken the ordinance of God. They now ask of me a just decision and desire to draw near to God. Saying, "Why have we fasted and thou hast not seen? We have humbled our souls and thou hast not known." In the very days of your fasts you enjoy your own pleasures and goad all them who are under your controul. You fast for strife and debate; and smite the poor with your fists. Why fast ye for me as to-day that by a cry your voice may be heard? This is not such a fast as I have chosen, that a man should afflict his soul for a day. No: though thou shouldst bend thy neck like a hook and lay sackcloth and ashes under thee: even in that case you are not to call it an acceptable fast.

It is not such a fast as this that I have chosen, saith the Lord. But loose every bond of iniquity; dissolve the obligations of onerous contracts; set at liberty them who are oppressed, and tear in pieces every unjust stipulation in writing: deal out thy bread to the hungry, and take into thy house the poor who have no shelter; if thou seest one naked, clothe him, and look not scornfully on dependants of thy race; then shall thy light break forth like the morning, and thy remedies shall spring up speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of the Lord will surround thee. Then thou shalt cry and God will answer thee; and whilst thou art speaking he will say, Lo I am here.

If thou remove from thee the bond, and the vote and decree which occasion murmuring, and from thy soul give bread to the hungry and satisfy an afflicted soul; then shall thy light spring up in darkness; and thy darkness shall be as the noon day: and thy God will be with thee continually; and thou shalt be satisfied as thy soul desireth; and thy bones shall be made fat and be like a watered garden, and like a spring whose water never failed. And thine old waste places shall be rebuilt; and thy foundations shall last for generations of generations: and thou shalt be called the repairer of breaches, and shalt enjoy rest in the midst of thy paths.
13 If on account of the sabbaths thou restrain thy foot from doing thy pleasure on that holy day; and call the sabbaths delightful, dedicated to God; and wilt not lift up thy foot for any work; nor utter a word in anger from thy mouth; and trust continually in the Lord; he will then mount thee on the good places of the land and feed thee on the inheritance of thy father Jacob: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken these words.

LIX. It is not that the hand of the Lord is unable to save; nor that his ear is grown dull to hear; but your sins make a separation between you and your God; and on account of your sins he hath turned away his face from you that he may not exercise compassion. For your hands are polluted with blood, and your fingers with sins; your lips have spoken iniquity, and your tongue contriveth injustice. None speaketh just things, nor is there any just judgment. They trusted in vanities and they speak lies. Because they hatch mischief, therefore they bring forth iniquity. They hatched the eggs of asps, and are weaving a spider's web; and he who was about to eat some of their eggs, upon breaking one that was hatched found there- in a viper. Their web will not serve for a mantle, nor can they clothe themselves with their works; for their works are works of iniquity. Their feet are running to evil; they are swift to shed blood. And their reasonings are reasonings for murders. Destruction and misery are in their ways, and the path of peace they do not know, nor is there any judgment in their ways; for the paths which they travel are crooked and peace they do not know. Therefore judgment is far from them, and saving mercy shall not overtake them. When they were waiting for light, darkness came upon them, expecting a blaze of light they walked in obscurity. They shall grope like blind men for a wall and feel about like men who have no eyes, and fall at mid-day as at midnight. When dying they will groan like a bear and mourn like a dove; and at their departing say, "We waited for judgment and there is none: and as for safety, it is far from us. For our manifold iniquity is before thee; and our sins are risen up against us: for our iniquities are in us, and we know our transgressions. We have sinned; we have lied, and turned back from following our God; we
14 have spoken things unjust, and have been disobedient; we have conceived and meditated from our heart lying words, we have indeed turned judgment backward, therefore saving mercy standeth aloof."

(p) Because truth was destroyed in their ways and they could not walk in straight paths; and truth was removed and they substituted opinion in place of knowledge, therefore the Lord took a view, and it displeased him that there was no judgment. When he took a view and there was no man; and made close observation, and there was no helper; then with his own arm he defended them and with mercy supported them. And he put on righteousness as a breast plate, and placed on his head the helmet of salvation, and threw around him the mantle of vengeance; and his cloak, as about to retribute retribution—reproach to his adversaries: and they from the west shall revere the name of the Lord; and they from the risings of the sun, his glorious name. For he will come like an impetuous stream—for the wrath of the Lord will come with fury. For the sake of Sion the Deliverer will come, and turn away ungodliness from Jacob. And this shall be my covenant with them, said the Lord, this spirit of mine which is upon thee, and these words which I have put in thy mouth shall not fail from thy mouth, nor from the mouth of thy seed, (for the Lord hath spoken) from this time forth forever.

LX. Sect. 11. BE ENLIGHTENED: be enlightened, O Jerusalem! for thy light is come; and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. Behold darkness will cover the earth and thick darkness the nations: but upon thee the Lord will shine and his glory over thee will be conspicuous. And kings will walk by thy light: and nations by thy splendour.

4 Raise thine eyes around and behold thy children gathered together; all thy sons are come from afar, and thy daughters shall be carried on shoulders. Then thou wilt look and be filled with awe and astonished at heart; because the riches of the sea and of nations and peoples will pour in upon thee. And for thee will come herds of camels and those of Madiam and Gaipha will cover thee, and those of Saba will come bringing gold and will also bring frankincense, and with joy proclaim the salvation of the Lord. And all the flocks of Kedar shall be
gathered together; and the rams of Nabaioth will come; and acceptable offerings will be made on mine altar, and my house of prayer will be glorified.

8 (c) Who are those? They are flying like clouds, and like doves with their young towards me!

9 (J) For me the islands waited, and among the first the ships of Tarsis to bring thy children from afar and their silver and their gold with them. And because of the holy name of the Lord, and because the Holy One of Israel is glorious;

10 therefore strangers shall rebuild thy walls and their kings shall wait upon thee. For on account of my wrath I smote thee, but

11 for mercy's sake I have loved thee; and thy gates shall be open continually (by day or by night they shall not be shut) to introduce to thee the wealth of nations and their kings pompously attended. For the nations and kings which will not serve thee shall perish—such nations indeed shall be utterly laid waste.

13 The glory of Lebanon also shall come to thee, with the cypress and the pine and the cedar, to adorn the place which

14 is dedicated to me. And to thee shall come trembling the sons of them who afflicted and humbled thee, and thou shalt be called, City Sion of the Holy one of Israel.

15 Because of thy having been forsaken and hated when there was no helper, I will make thee an everlasting boast—a joy for perpetual generations. And thou shalt suck the milk of nations, and feed on the wealth of kings, and shalt know that I the Lord am thy Saviour, and that thy Redeemer is the God of Israel. And instead of brass I will bring thee gold; and instead of iron I will bring thee silver; and instead of wood I will bring thee brass and instead of stones iron. And I will make thy chiefs peaceful and thine overseers righteous; and violence shall no more be heard in thy land, nor destruction nor misery in thy borders; but thy walls shall be called Salvation and thy gates, sculpture. And thou shalt no more have the sun for a light by day nor shall the rising of the moon enlighten thy night; but the Lord will be to thee an everlasting light; and thy

20 God will be thy glory. For thy sun shall not go down nor shall thy moon ever wane: For the Lord will be to thee an everlasting light; and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. And thy peo-
ple shall be all righteous, they shall inherit the land forever, preserving the plant, the works of their hands, for glory. The fewest in number shall become thousands, and he who is smallest, a great nation. I the Lord in due time will gather them.

LXI. Sect. 12. (M) THE SPIRIT of the Lord is upon me, for the business for which he anointed me. He hath sent me to publish glad tidings to the poor, to heal them who are broken hearted; to proclaim a deliverance to captives, and a recovery of sight to the blind: to proclaim an acceptable year of the Lord and a day of retribution. To comfort all who are mourning; that to the mourners in Sion may be given, glory instead of ashes, oil of joy to the mourners, robes of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called generations of righteousness, a plant of the Lord for glory. And the wastes of old times shall be rebuilded; and former desolations shall be repaired, and wasted cities renewed which had lain in ruins for ages. And strangers shall come and feed thy flocks and foreigners shall be thy ploughmen and vine dressers. But you shall be called priests of the Lord, ministers of God. You shall eat the wealth of nations and for their riches be admired. Thus shall they again inherit the land; and everlasting joy shall be on their head. For I am the Lord who love righteousness and hate the spoils of injustice; and I will give the righteous the fruit of their toil and make an everlasting covenant with them and their seed shall be distinguished among the nations, and their offspring in the midst of peoples. Every one who seeth them will know them, that they are a seed whom God hath blessed. And they shall rejoice in the Lord with joy.

(c) Rejoice in the Lord, O my soul, for he hath clothed me with the mantle of Salvation, and with an under garment of gladness, he hath crowned me as a bridegroom with a crown and adorned me as a bride, with jewels, and like the earth blooming with flowers. And as a garden causeth its seeds to vegetate, so will the Lord cause righteousness to spring up and joy in the presence of all the nations.

LXII. (M) For Sion's sake I will not be silent, and for the sake of Jerusalem I will not rest; until the righteousness thereof
2 break forth as light, and my salvation blaze like a torch; and nations see thy righteousness, and kings this glory of thine. When he shall call thee by a new name which the Lord himself will give thee; then thou shalt be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.

3 And thou shalt no more be called, Forsaken; nor shall thy land any more be called, The desert; but thy name shall be called, My Delight; and that of thy country, The inhabited land. Because the Lord is well pleased with thee therefore thy land shall be thickly inhabited: and as a youth cohabiting with a virgin bride, so shall thy sons inhabit it: and as a bridegroom will rejoice in his bride, so will the Lord rejoice over thee.

4 Now upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, I have set watchmen all the day; and all the night, they will not cease continually

7 to mention the Lord; for there is none like you. When he shall have re-established and made Jerusalem a boast on the earth—the Lord hath sworn by his glory and by the power of his arm, I will no more give thy corn and thy food to thine enemies; nor shall the sons of strangers any more drink thy wine,

9 for which thou hast laboured. But they who reap the harvest shall eat and praise the Lord; and they who gather the vintage

10 shall drink wine in my holy courts. Go through my gates and prepare the way for my people and throw the stones out of the way. Erect a standard for the nations. For lo! the Lord hath published this to the end of the earth. Say to the daughter of Sion, Behold the Saviour is come for thee, having his own re-

12 ward and his work before him. And he will call this a holy people, redeemed by the Lord; and thou shalt be called the city sought and not forsaken.

LXIII. (c) Who is this who is coming from Edom? What redness of mantles from Bosor! He so magnificent in apparel? He marcheth with majesty!

2 (M) I proclaim righteousness and the judgment of salvation.

(c) Why are thy garments red and thy clothing, as from a trodden wine-vat?

3 (M) I am full of a country trodden down; and of the nations there is not a man with me. I have trodden them down
in my wrath, and crumbled them like dust and shed their blood on the earth. For the day of retribution came upon them and the year of redemption is at hand. When I looked and there was no helper and observed that none upheld; then mine own arm delivered them. Mine indignation indeed was roused, and I trampled them down in mine anger and shed their blood on the earth.

(c) I recollected the loving kindness of the Lord—the mercies of the Lord in all those things which he retributeth for us. The Lord is a good judge to the house of Israel. He dealeth with us according to his tender mercy and according to the abundance of his saving goodness, and said, "Is not this my people? Children should not rebel." And he became their Saviour from all their distress.

It was not an ambassador nor a messenger; but he himself saved them. Through his love and his indulgence to them, he himself redeemed them and took them up, and exalted them all the days of old. But they rebelled and provoked his holy spirit; so he became their enemy. He fought against them; though he remembered the days of old.

O! where is he who caused the shepherd of his flock to come up out of the sea? Where is he, who put his holy spirit in them? That glorious arm of his which led Moses by the right hand? He forced back the water from before him, to make himself an everlasting name. He led them through the deep, like a horse through a desert; and they were not fatigued: and like cattle through a plain. A spirit from the Lord descended and conducted them. Thus thou didst lead this people of thine, to make thyself a glorious name. Return from heaven and take a view from the house of thy sanctuary and thy glory. Where is thy zeal and thy majesty? Where the abundance of thy loving kindness and tender affections, that thou hast withdrawn thyself from us? For thou art our father. Because Abraham knoweth us not, and Israel hath not acknowledged us; do thou, O Lord, our father, do thou deliver us. From the beginning thy name is upon us; why, O Lord hast thou suffered us to wander from thy way, and our hearts to be hardened so as not to fear thee? Return for the sake of thy servants—for the sake of the tribes of thy heritage,
18 that we may inherit a little of thy holy mountain. We are be-
19 come as at the beginning, when thou didst not rule over us,
and when we were not called by thy name.

LXIV. If thou wilt open the heaven, at thy presence terror
2 will seize the mountains, and they will melt as wax melteth
before fire; and a fire will burn up the adversaries, and thy
name will be manifest to the adversaries—At thy presence
3 the nations will be troubled. When thou executest thy glo-
rious works, because of thee terror will seize the mountains.
4 Never have we heard, nor have our eyes seen a God be-
sides thee; nor works such as thine, which thou wilt do for
5 them who wait for mercy. For it will meet them who prac-
tise righteousness, and they will remember their ways. Behold
6 thou wast angry when we sinned; because of this we wan-
dered and became all of us as unclean, and all our righteous-
ness was like a polluted rag; and for our iniquities we have
7 fallen like leaves; so that the wind will sweep us away. There
is indeed none who invoketh thy name, or who remembered
to lay hold on thee; because thou hast turned away thy face
from us, and delivered us up for our sins.
8 But now, O Lord, thou art our father. Though we are clay,
9 we are all the works of thy hands: be not angry with us to the ut-
termost; nor remember forever our sins: but, O, look down
10 now upon us; for we are all thy people. The city of thy sanc-
tuary is become a desert: Sion is become like a desert; Je-
11 rusalem, for a curse. The house, our sanctuary—even that
glory which our fathers blessed, is utterly burnt up with fire,
12 and all our glorious things are in ruins; yet for all these things,
thou, O Lord, hast refrained, and been silent. Thou hast
humbled us exceedingly.

LXV. (M) I became manifest to them who inquired not for
me; I was found by them who sought me not. I said, "Be-
hold here I am" to the nation which did not invoke my name.
2 I stretched out my hands all the day long to a disobedient and
gainsaying people, who were walking not in a good way, but
3 following their own sins. This people are provoking me con-
tinually to my face. They will sacrifice in the gardens and
burn incense on the tiles, to demons which have not an ex-
4 istence. They sleep in tombs and in caverns for the purpose
of dreaming: they eat swine's flesh, and the broth of sacrifices; all their vessels are polluted; yet they say, "Keep at a distance from me; come not near me, for I am clean." This is a smoke which causeth my wrath; a fire is kindled by it every day. Behold it is written before me: I will not keep silence, until I have retributed into their bosom their sins; and the sins of their fathers, saith the Lord. They have burned incense on the mounts, and treated me with scorn on the hills, I will retribute their works into their bosom.

Thus saith the Lord, As when a good grape is found in the cluster, they will say, "Destroy it not; for there is a blessing in it," so will I do for the sake of him who serveth me; for his sake I will not destroy them all. I will indeed bring forth the seed from Jacob namely, from Juda, and he shall inherit my holy mountain: and my chosen ones and my servants shall inherit and dwell there; and there shall be in the forest folds for flocks; and the valley of Achor shall be a resting place of herds, for my people who have sought me. But as for you, who forsake me and forget my holy mountain, and who prepare a table for the Demon, and fill up a mixed potion for Fortune, you I will deliver up to the sword; you shall all bow down to slaughter. Because I called and you answered not: I spake and you would not listen; but did what is evil in my sight; and chose the things in which I did not delight; therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold my servants shall eat; but you shall be hungry: behold my servants shall drink; but you shall be thirsty: behold my servants shall rejoice; but you shall be ashamed: behold my servants shall triumph with joy: But you shall scream for sorrow of heart, and howl for anguish of spirit. For you, shall leave your name for a loathing to my chosen. As for you, the Lord will destroy you; but to my servants, a new name shall be given which shall be blessed on the earth: for they will bless the true God: and they who swear on the earth, will swear by the true God. For they will forget their former affliction and it shall not recur to their mind: for there shall be a new heaven and the earth shall be new: and they shall no more remember former things, nor shall they ever come again into their mind. But in this they shall find joy and gladness: for behold I am about to make
Jerusalem a subject of joy, and this people of mine a subject of rejoicing. And I will exult in Jerusalem and rejoice in my people; and there shall no more be heard therein, the voice of wailing nor the sound of a mournful cry. Nor shall there any more be there an untimely birth, nor an old man, who shall not complete his term. For he who is a hundred years old shall be young; and the sinner, who dieth at a hundred years, shall be deemed accursed. And they shall build houses and dwell therein: and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruits thereof. They shall not build, and others inhabit: nor shall they plant and others eat: for according to the days of the tree of that life, shall be the days of this my people: for they shall out wear the works of their toils. My chosen ones shall not labour in vain, nor shall they bring forth children for a curse. Because they are a seed blessed of God, both they and their offspring: therefore it shall come to pass, that before they call I will answer them: and while they are yet speaking I will say, What is the matter. Then shall the wolves and the lambs feed together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. But the serpent shall eat dust as bread. They shall not hurt, nor shall they destroy on my holy mountain, saith the Lord.

Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth, my footstool: what sort of an house will you build for me? And of what sort shall be the place of my rest? For all these things my hand hath made: and all these things are mine saith the Lord. Upon whom therefore will I look down, but upon him only who is humble and quiet, and who trembleth at my words? As for the wicked man, who sacrificeth to me a young bull: he is one who slayeth a dog: and though he offereth me fine flour: it will be as the blood of swine.—Though he offereth incense for a memorial, he is as a blasphemer. As they have chosen their own ways: and their soul hath delighted in their abominations: I also will chuse their delusions, and pay them back their sins. Because I called them and they did not answer—I spake, but they did not listen: but did that which is evil in my sight, and chose the things in which I did not delight; hear the decisions of the Lord—ye who tremble at his word, say, "O our brethren—(to them
who hate you and are abominable, that the name of the Lord may be glorified and appear to their joy, when they shall be ashamed) a sound of screaming from the city! a sound from the temple! the voice of the Lord rendering a recompense to his adversaries!

7 That a woman hath brought forth before she travailed; that before her pangs came on, they are over and a male child born; who hath heard such a thing, or who hath seen the like? Did ever the earth bring forth in a day, or was ever a nation born at once? That Sion should travail and bring forth her children, I myself gave this expectation; yet thou didst not remember me, saith the Lord. Behold did I not make her who beareth; and her who is barren? Said thy God.

10 Rejoice O Jerusalem! and sing praises therein, all ye who love her! Be exceedingly joyful with her, all ye who mourn for her!

11 That you may suck and be satisfied from the breast of her consolation—that you may suck and be fed deliciously, at the commencement of her glory. For thus saith the Lord, Behold I will glide to them like a peaceful stream, and like a torrent deluging the glory of nations. Their children shall be carried on shoulders, and shall be dandled on knees. As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you, and in Jerusalem you shall find consolation. And you shall see it, and your heart shall rejoice; and your bones shall flourish like a green herb. And the hand of the Lord will be made known to them who fear him. And it will terrify them who are disobedient. For behold! the Lord will come as a fire, and his chariots as a whirlwind, to execute his vengeance with wrath and his rebuke with flaming fire. For with the fire of the Lord all this land shall be tried, and all flesh with his sword. Many shall be the slain of the Lord! They who consecrate and purify themselves for the gardens, and they who, in the outer courts, eat swine's flesh, and the abominations and the mouse, shall for this be consumed together, said the Lord.

18 As I know their works and their reasoning I am coming to gather together all the nations and the tongues, and they shall come and see my glory. And I will leave among them a sign, and those of them who escape I will send to the nations—to Tharsis and Phud and Lud and Mosach and to
Thobel and Greece and to the far distant isles. They who have not heard my name nor seen my glory—even they shall proclaim my glory among the nations; and they shall bring your brethren from all the nations, as a gift for the Lord with horses and chariots, in litters borne by mules with umbrellas over them, to the holy city Jerusalem, said the Lord; as the children of Israel brought up their sacrifices for me with songs of praise to the house of the Lord. And of them I will take priests and Levites, said the Lord. For as the new heaven and the new earth, which I make, shall remain in my presence, saith the Lord; so shall your seed and your name be established. And it shall be, that month after month and sabbath after sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, in Jerusalem, said the Lord. And they shall go forth, and see the carcases of those men, who have transgressed against me. For their worm shall not die and their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh.

JEREMIAS.

I. The word of God which came to Jeremias the son of Chelkias, one of the priests who dwelt at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin; as the word of God came to him in the days of Josias son of Amos king of Juda, in the thirteenth year of his reign and came to him in the days of Joakim son of Josias king of Juda even to the eleventh year of Zedekias son of Josias king of Juda, even to the capture of Jerusalem, in the fifth month.

When this word of the Lord came to him, "Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee, and before thou wast born I hallowed thee. I have appointed thee a prophet for nations."

Thereupon I said, O self-existent sovereign, Lord! behold I know not how to speak, for I am a child. And the Lord said to me, say not "For I am a child." For thou shalt go to all, to whomsoever I send thee; and according to all that I command thee thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee saith the Lord.
9 Then the Lord stretched forth his hand towards me and touched my mouth; and the Lord said to me, Behold I have put my words in thy mouth. Behold I have this day set thee over nations and over kingdoms to root out and demolish and destroy; and to rebuild and plant.

10 Then a word of the Lord came to me saying, "What dost thou see." Whereupon I said, "I see a rod of an almond-tree."

12 And the Lord said to me, Thou hast seen well: for I have watched over my words to perform them.

13 Again a word of the Lord came to me a second time saying: "What dost thou see?" And I said, "A kettle; its bottom glowing hot; and its mouth from the north. Then the Lord said to me, "From the north shall blaze out the evils against all the inhabitants of this land." For behold I am calling together all the kingdoms of the earth from the north, saith the Lord; and they shall come and set, every one his throne against the vestibules of the gates of Jerusalem and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Juda: and I will speak to them with a judicial process touching all their wickedness.

17 As they have forsaken me and sacrificed to strange Gods, and worshipped the works of their hands, therefore gird thou up thy loins and stand up and speak all that I command thee. Be not afraid of them, nor terrified at their presence; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord. Behold I have made thee this day, like a fortified city and like a wall of brass, too strong for all the kings of Juda and the chiefs thereof and the people of the land. Though they fight against thee they cannot prevail over thee; for I am with thee to deliver thee saith the Lord.

II. Then he said, Thus saith the Lord, I remembered mercy in thy youth; and love, in thy mature age, that thou mightest follow the Holy Israel, saith the Lord. The Holy Israel is to the Lord the chief of his productions, all that devour him shall be guilty of trespass: evils shall come upon them, saith the Lord.

4 Hear a word of the Lord, O house of Jacob and every family of the house of Israel. Thus saith the Lord,
What fault did your fathers find in me, that they have withdrawn from me; and have gone after vanities and become vain: and did not say, Where is the Lord, who brought us up out of the land of Egypt; who led us through the wilderness—through a boundless and untrodden land—through a land without water and without fruit—through a land which no man traversed, and where no man had a fixed abode.

When I brought you to Charmel that you might eat its fruits and the good things thereof; you entered in and polluted my land; and made my heritage an abomination. The priests did not say, "Where is the Lord?" and they who studied the law did not know me; the pastors also transgressed against me; and the prophets prophesied for Baal and went after an unprofitable thing. For this also I will empead you; and your childrens' children I will empead. For go to the isles of Chet-tim and see; and send to Kedar and make strict inquiry; and see if such things have ever happened: have nations changed their Gods, though they are no Gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which will not profit them. At this the heaven was astonished and shocked exceedingly, saith the Lord. Because my people did two things which are both evil: they forsook me, the fountain of living water; and hewed out for themselves broken cisterns which cannot hold water.

Is Israel a slave or a home born servant? Why was he for a prey? Against him lions roared and uttered their voice: they have made his land a desert and his cities are demolished so as to be uninhabitable. Even the sons of Memphis and Taph-nas have known and derided thee. Hath not thy forsaking me, saith the Lord thy God, brought these things upon thee?

Now therefore what hast thou to do with the way to Egypt? Is it to drink the water of Geon? Or what hast thou to do in the way to the Assyrians? Is it to drink the water of rivers?

Let this apostacy of thine correct thee. And thy wickedness work conviction in thee. And know and see how bitter a thing it is to forsake me, saith the Lord thy God.

Further, I have no pleasure in thee, saith the Lord thy God, because of old thou hast broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands, and said, I will not serve thee; but I will go up
every high mount: and under every shady tree, I will there indulge my wantonness.

21 I indeed planted thee an entirely good and fruitful vine:
22 how art thou, O degenerate vine, turned to bitterness? Though thou wash thyself with nitre and use much soap: thou art
23 stained by thine iniquities in my sight, saith the Lord. How canst thou say, I am not polluted, nor have I gone after Baal?
View thy ways in the grave-yard, and recollect what thou hast
24 done. In the evening her voice raised the mournful cry. She enlarged her ways to the waters of a desert: by the desires of her soul she was transported into raptures. She is delivered up: who will bring her back? None who seek her will weary themselves. In her humiliation they shall find her.

25 Turn thy foot from a rugged way, and thy throat from thirst. But she said, I will act like one come to maturity. Because she loved strangers, therefore after them she did go.—
26 As a thief when taken, is ashamed; so shall the children of Israel be put to shame.

They and their kings and their chiefs and their priests and
27 their prophets, said to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast begotten me. And turned their backs to me and not their faces: yet in the time of their troubles they will
28 say, Arise and save us. Where now are thy gods which thou hast made for thyself? Will they arise and save in the time of thy trouble?

Since according to the number of thy cities were thy gods O Juda—and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem they burned incense to Baal; why do you address me? You are all guilty of impiety: and you have all transgressed against me, saith the Lord. In vain have I smitten your children, you did not receive instruction: a sword devoured your prophets, like a ravening lion; and you were not terrified.—
31 Hear a word of the Lord! Thus saith the Lord, Was I a desert to Israel or a desolate land? Why did my people say, "We will not be lorded over, nor come to thee any more."
32 Will a bride forget her attire; or a virgin, the ornaments that deck her bosom? Yet my people have forgotten me, days
33 without number. Wilt thou yet study any decency in thy ways in search of love? Far from that, thou hast abandoned
34 thyself to wickedness to pollute thy ways. And on thy hands hath been found the blood of innocent souls. These I did not find in breaches into houses, but in every grove of oaks. Yet thou sayest, "I am innocent; let his wrath be turned from me:" behold I will empeal thee for saying, I have not sinned. Because thou hast made very light of repeating thy journeys, therefore thou shalt be made ashamed of Egypt, as thou hast been, of Assyria: for thou shalt come up thence with thy hands on thy head, for the Lord hath rejected thy confidence III. and thou shalt not prosper in it. If a man divorce his wife and she depart from him and marry another, can she return again to him? Would not such a wife be altogether polluted?

2 Yet thou hast played the harlot with many shepherds and hast returned to me saith the Lord. Raise thine eyes, look forward and take a view! where is there a place in which thou hast not prostituted thyself? In the highways thou hast sat for them like a deserted daw, and polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wicked acts, and retained many shepherds for a stumbling block to thyself: yet with the face of a harlot and behaving indecently before them all, hast thou not returned home and called me father and the guide of thy youth? Will anger continue forever? Shall it be kept up to the last? Behold thou hast spoken and done these evil things: yet thou hast prevailed.

6 II. AGAIN the Lord said to me in the days of Josias the king, Hast thou seen what the house of Israel have done to me? They have gone up upon every high mountain and under every shady tree and have there committed whoredom—and after she had committed all these acts of whoredom I said,
8 Return to me; but she returned not. And the treacherous Juda saw this treachery; and I saw that when for all the whoredoms which Israel had committed and in which she had been caught, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce in her hands, the treacherous Juda was not terrified, but went
9 and committed the like herself. Indeed the other's fornication was as nothing; she committed adultery with stocks and stones, and for all this the treacherous Juda turned not to me
11 with her whole heart but only feignedly. Then the Lord said
12 to me, Israel hath justified herself more than the treacherous
Juda; go and proclaim these words to the north and thou shalt say, Return to me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord, and I will not set my face against you. For I am merciful, saith the Lord and will not be angry with you forever. Nevertheless acknowledge thine iniquity—that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God, and opened thy ways for strangers under every shady tree; and hast not hearkened to my voice, saith the Lord. Return, O apostate children, saith the Lord: for I will exercise dominion over you, and take one of a city and two of a family and bring you to Sion: and I will give you pastors according to mine own heart, and they shall tend and feed you with knowledge. And when you are multiplied and increased in the land, saith the Lord, in those days they shall no more say, "The ark of the covenant of the Holy Israel." It shall no more come to mind nor be named; nor shall it be covered nor made any more. In those days and at that time Jerusalem shall be called The Throne of the Lord, and all the nations shall be gathered to it. And they shall no more follow the desires of their own wicked heart. In those days the house of Juda shall unite with the house of Israel, and they shall come together from the land of the north and from all those countries, to the land which I put in possession of their fathers.

(p) (Whereupon I said, so be it, O Lord.)
(J) Because I am to rank thee among children and give thee a choice land—the heritage of God the Supreme Ruler of nations; therefore I said, "Call me Father," and, "From me you shall not turn away." But as a wife dealeth treacherously with her husband, so the house of Israel dealt treacherously with me, saith the Lord. A sound from the lips was heard, of the wailing and supplication of the children of Israel; because they had transgressed in their ways—had forgotten God their Holy One. Return, return, O children, and I will heal your bruises.

(c) Behold we will be thy servants for thou art the Lord our God. False indeed have been the hills and the strength of the mountains, but from the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel. This shame consumed the labours of our fathers from our youth—Their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. We lay down in our shame and our dishonour co-
vered us; because we sinned against our God—both we and our fathers from our youth to this day; and hearkened not to the voice of the Lord our God.

IV. (J) If Israel will return, saith the Lord; let him return to me. And if he will remove his abominations from his mouth,
2 and on account of me be filled with holy awe; and swear "As the Lord liveth" with truth in judgment and justice: then
3 shall the nations bless by him, and by him praise God in Jerusalem. For thus saith the Lord to the men of Juda and inhabitants of Jerusalem, Break up for yourselves fallow grounds
4 and sow not among thorns: be circumcised for your God and circumcise the stubbornness of your hearts, O men of Juda and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath break out like a fire and burn; and there be none to quench it, because of the wickedness of your devices.

5 II. (J) MAKE proclamation in Juda and let it be heard in Jerusalem. Say, Sound the trumpet in the land; raise the screaming cry! Say, Assemble together and let us go into the walled cities! Break up and flee to Sion; make all haste; tarry not: for I am bringing evils from the north and a great destruction. A lion has gone up from his den: a destroyer of nations hath begun his march and is come from his place to make this land a desolation; and the cities shall be demolished so as to be uninhabitable. For these things gird on sackcloth; wail and utter lamentation. Because the wrath of the Lord is not turned away from you, therefore it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord; that the understanding of the king shall be destroyed; and the understanding of the chiefs; and the priests shall be confounded and the prophets amazed.

10 (p) Upon this I said, O Sovereign Lord! hast thou indeed deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, "There shall be peace," when lo! the sword hath reached their very soul?

11 (J) At that time let it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, there is a spirit of wandering in the wilderness. The way of the daughter of my people is not to purity nor to holiness. A spirit of execution shall come for me and I am now denouncing my judgments on them. Behold he shall come up
like a cloud, and his chariots like a whirlwind. His horses are swifter than eagles.

14 (p) Alas for us! we are undone! O Jerusalem! wash thy heart from wickedness that thou mayst be saved. How long do ill grounded reasonings for thy troubles remain in thee?

15 (J) Because the voice of a messenger will come from Dan and distress will be heard from mount Ephraim; Call to mind the nations: behold they are come. Proclaim in Jerusalem, "Predatory bands are coming from afar, and have uttered their voice against the cities of Juda." Like men watching a field they are all around her. Because thou wast not mindful of me saith the Lord, thy ways and thy devices have done these things to thee. It is owing to thy wickedness that they are bitter—that they have reached thy very heart.

19 (p) My bowels! my bowels are pained! and every sensation of my heart. My soul throbbeth! my heart is torn. I cannot keep silence; for my soul hath heard the trumpet's sound; the din of war and of distress. It calleth for contrition; for the whole land is in deep distress. My tent is suddenly whelmed in ruin; my curtains are rent to pieces. How long shall I see men fleeing! How long hear the sound of trumpets!

22 (J) Because the rulers of my people did not know me, they are foolish children and devoid of understanding. They are wise to do evil; but to do good they have no knowledge.

23 (p) I beheld the earth and lo! a void! Then the heaven; and its lights were gone. I beheld the mountains; and they were trembling, and all the hills were in perturbation. I looked; and lo! there was not a man; and all the birds of the air were flown. I beheld; and lo! Karmel was a desert; and all the cities were burned with fire. At the presence of the Lord; and because of his fierce anger, they are utterly destroyed.

27 (J) Thus saith the Lord, The whole land shall be a desert; but I will not make a complete end. For these things let the land mourn; and the heaven above be covered with darkness; for I have spoken and I will not change my mind, I have made an assault and will not withdraw from it.

29 (p) At the sound of the cavalry and bended bow all the country had fled. They had skulked into caves; and hidden
themselves in forests; and upon rocks they had climbed up. Every city was deserted; in them not a man dwelt.

30 - And as for thee what wilt thou do? Though thou clothe thyself with scarlet and deck thyself with ornaments of gold—though thou paint thine eyes with stibium, thy decoration will avail nothing; thy lovers have cast thee off. They will seek thy life. For I have heard a sound as of one in labour—of thy groan, as of one who beareth her first child.

(J) The voice of the daughter of Sion shall be weak: and she shall let her hands hang down.

(p) Wo is me! for my soul fainteth on account of the slain.

V. (J) Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem; and look, and inquire, and search in her broad ways. If you can find—if there be a man, who executeth judgment and seeketh truth, I will be merciful to them saith the Lord. They say, "As the Lord liveth." Do they not on this very account swear to falsehoods?

3 (p) O Lord, thine eyes look for faithfulness. Thou hast chastised them: but they have not grieved. Thou hast consumed them and they would not receive instruction. They have made their faces harder than a rock and refused to return.

4 Then I said, perhaps they are poor, therefore they could not. Because they have not known the way of the Lord and the judgment of God, I will go to the nobles and speak to them.

(J) Because these knew the way of the Lord and the judgment of God, and lo! with one consent, have broken the yoke and burst the bands; therefore a lion from the forest hath smitten them and a wolf hath destroyed them even in their houses, and a leopard hath lain in wait against their cities. Let all who go out from them be hunted down. Because they have multiplied their iniquities—have strengthened themselves in their apostacies; for which of these can I be merciful to thee? Thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by things which are no Gods. When I fed them plentifully, they committed adultery, and revelled in the houses of harlots. They became furious wanton steeds; they neighed every one for his neighbour's wife. Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord, and on such a nation as his shall not my soul be avenged? Go
up against her battlements and demolish them: but you must not make a complete destruction; leave her buttresses, for they are the Lord's. Because the house of Israel have broken faith with me, saith the Lord, and the house of Juda have given the lie to their Lord and said, "These things are not so. Evils will not come upon us; we shall see neither sword nor famine. Our prophets are but wind and the word of the Lord was not in them."

Therefore thus saith the Lord Almighty, because you have spoken this word; behold I have made these words of mine for thy mouth, a fire; and this people fuel; and it shall devour them. Behold I am about to bring against you, O house of Israel, saith the Lord, a nation from afar—a nation the sound of whose tongue thou wilt not understand. They are all mighty men; and they shall devour your harvest and your bread; and they shall devour your sons and your daughters; and they shall devour your flocks and your herds; and they shall devour your vineyards and fig trees and olive orchards, and smite with the sword your fortified cities, in which you trusted. But it shall come to pass in those days, saith the Lord thy God, That I will not make an entire end of you.

Now when you say, "Why hath the Lord our God done all this to us?" then thou shalt say to them, Because you served strange Gods in your land, therefore you shall serve strange Gods in a land which is not yours. Proclaim these things to the house of Jacob and let them be published to the house of Juda.

(p) Hear these things I beseech you, O foolish and stupid people!

(J) They have eyes, but they do not see; ears they have, but they do not hear. Will you not fear me, saith the Lord, nor be struck with awe at the presence of me who have by an everlasting decree, made sand a boundary to the ocean, so that it shall not pass it. Though it be tossed with a tempest, it shall not prevail—though the waves thereof roar, they shall not overpass it. But this people have a revolting and disobedient heart. They have turned aside and are gone: and did not say in their heart, let us now fear the Lord our God, who giveth
us the former and the latter rain, according to the time of completing the appointed harvest.

25 (p) Though he had reserved these for us, your iniquities have turned them out of their course: and your sins have removed good things from you.

26 (J) Since there have been found among my people wicked men, who have set snares to destroy men and have caught them—As a trap which hath been set is full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit, therefore they became great and rich

28 and overleaped judgment: they did not administer justice to the orphan, nor decide righteously the cause of the widow;

29 shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord, and on such a nation as this shall not my soul be avenged?

30 Astonishing and horrible things have been done in this land. The prophets prophesy falsehoods, and the priests clapped with their hands, and my people loved to have it so. Now what will you do in regard to the consequences?

VI. Assume courage ye sons of Benjamin who are from the midst of Jerusalem, and give a signal with the trumpet at Thekoe; and on Bethacharma erect a standard. Because evils from the north are apparent, and a great destruction is begun, therefore thy loftiness shall be destroyed. With regard to the daughter of Sion; to her shepherds shall come with their flocks, and pitch their tents around against her and feed. [They will say] every one to his band "Prepare yourselves for battle against her, arise and let us go up against her at noon." "Alas for us the day is declined," "Because the shadows of the day fail, arise and let us go up against her by night, and let us destroy her foundations." For thus saith the Lord, Cut down her trees: discharge engines against Jerusalem: O lying city! in it all is oppression. As a reservoir sendeth forth water, so her wickedness gusheth out. Open wickedness and misery may be heard in her continually. With anguish and scourging be instructed, O Jerusalem! lest my soul be alienated from thee—lest I make thee an untrodden land, which shall not be inhabited. For thus saith the Lord, Glean, glean as a vineyard the remains of Israel. Return again and again like a grape gatherer to his basket.
(p) To whom shall I speak and give warning that he may hearken? behold their ears are uncircumcised and they cannot hear.

(J) Behold the word of the Lord was to them an object of reproach and they would not. Therefore my wrath, which I filled up and restrained that I might not destroy them, I now pour out on infants in the streets, and on the congregation of youths at the same time. Because husband and wife shall be comprehended—the elder with him who is full of days; therefore their houses shall be transferred to others—their fields and their wives together. Because I will stretch forth my hand against the inhabitants of this land, saith the Lord—because from the least of them to the greatest, they have all committed unrighteous deeds; from the priest to the false prophet, they have all practised falsehood, and healed the hurt of my people by underrating it and saying Peace, Peace; but where is there peace? Were they ashamed because they failed? even in that case they were not ashamed; nor were they sensible of their infamy; therefore they shall fall in the common ruin; and in the time of visitation they shall perish, saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord, Stand in the highways and take a view and inquire for the ancient paths of the Lord, and see which is the good way and walk in it, and you shall find a purification for your souls: but they said, "We will not go."

I have set watchmen over you; hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, "We will not listen." Therefore the nations heard; even they who were tending their flocks.

Hear O earth, behold upon this people I am bringing evils—the fruit of their apostacy, because they attended not to my words and rejected my law. Why do you bring me incense from Saba, and cinnamon from a far distant country? Your whole burnt offerings are not acceptable; nor were your incense offerings sweet to me. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I send weakness on this people, and weak shall be fathers and sons with them; and neighbour with neighbour shall perish. Thus saith the Lord, Behold a people is coming from the north; and nations shall be roused from the extremity of the earth: they will grasp the bow and the spear: they are haughty and will show no mercy:
their voice is like the roaring sea: on horses and in chariots they will draw up in array like fire, for battle against thee, O daughter of Sion.

24 (c) We have heard the fame of them. Our hands are enfeebled. Anguish hath taken hold of us—pangs, as of a woman in travail.

25 (p) Go not out to the fields and in the highways walk not, because the sword of the enemy dwelleth all around. O daughter of my people gird thee with sackcloth; strew thyself with ashes: utter for thyself piteous lamentation like the mourning for a beloved. For misery will suddenly come upon thee.

27 (J) I have made thee an assayer for trying peoples: and thou shalt know me when I try their ways. They are all disobedient and walk perversely. Being brass and iron they are all utterly consumed. The bellows could not stand the fire: the lead is consumed. In vain doth the silversmith try to extract silver. Their wickedness was not to be melted. You shall call them rejected silver, for the Lord hath rejected them.

VII. 2 III. HEAR a word of the Lord, all ye of Judea! thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: amend your ways and your pursuits: and I will cause you to dwell in this place. Trust not in yourselves—in lying words: for you will derive no benefit from them who say, "The temple of the Lord! it is the temple of the Lord!" For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your pursuits, and actually execute judgment between man and man: and do not oppress the stranger and orphan and widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place, nor go after strange gods to your hurt: then will I cause you to dwell in this place—(in the land which I gave to your fathers) from age to age.

8 But if you continue to trust in lying words from which you can derive no benefit; and commit murder, and adultery and steal and swear to a falsehood, and burn incense to Baal; and when you have gone after strange gods which you did not know; you, because of your calamities, have then come and stood before me, in the house which is called by my name, and said, "We have been restrained from committing these abominations;" is not this house of mine, which is called by my name, be-
come in your eyes a den of robbers? Now behold I have seen this, saith the Lord. Go then to my place which was at Selo, where I caused my name to dwell at first; and see what I have done to it, for the wickedness of my people Israel. Now therefore because you have done all these things: and I have spoken to you and you have not hearkened to me; and I have called you and you have not answered; I therefore will do to this house which is called by my name, and in which you have placed your confidence; and to this place which I gave to you and your fathers; as I did to Selo. And I will drive you from my presence, as I have driven out your brethren, the whole seed of Ephraim. And as for thee, pray not thou for this people; nor supplicate for compassion to be shewn them: neither pray nor intercede with me for them; for I will not listen. Dost thou not see what they are doing in the cities of Juda and in the streets of Jerusalem? Their sons are collecting wood; and their fathers are kindling a fire: and their wives are kneading dough to make cakes for the host of heaven: and they have poured out libations to strange gods, to vex me. Do they vex me? Saith the Lord: do they not vex themselves; that their faces may be covered with shame? Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold my anger and my fury is poured upon this place and on these men; and on the cattle and on every tree of their field and on all the products of the ground, and it shall burn and shall not be quenched. Thus saith the Lord, Collect your whole burnt offerings with your sacrifices and eat flesh. Because I did not speak to your fathers nor give them a charge, on the day when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, concerning whole burnt offerings and sacrifices; but only gave them this charge saying, "Hearken to my voice and I will be your God and you shall be my people; and walk in all my ways which I command you that it may be well with you." But they hearkened not to me nor inclined their ear; but walked in the devices of their own wicked heart, and went backward and not forward from the day their fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day: though I sent to you all my servants the prophets—daily and early though I sent them, yet they hearkened not to me nor inclined their ears—nay they hardened their necks more than their fathers;
28 therefore thou shalt deliver to them this message. "This is the nation which hearkened not to the voice of the Lord, nor received instruction: faithfulness is gone from their mouth:
29 shave thy head and throw away the hair, and take up with thy lips a song of lamentation, for the Lord hath rejected and cast
30 off the generation which hath done these things." Because the children of Juda have done evil in my sight, saith the Lord, have set up their abominations in the house called by my name,
31 to pollute it; and have built up the altar of Tophet which is in the valley of the son of Ennom, to burn their sons and their daughters with fire; a thing which I never commanded them
32 and which never entered my mind; therefore, behold days are coming saith the Lord, when they shall no more say, The altar of Tophet, and the valley of the son of Ennom," but, "The valley of them who were slain." For they shall bury in
33 Tophet for want of room. And the carcasses of this people shall be for food for the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the
34 earth; and there shall be none to scare them away. And I will cause to cease from the cities of Juda and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy and the voice of gladness; the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the whole land shall be a desolation."

VIII. At that time saith the Lord, they shall carry out the bones of the kings of Juda, and the bones of his chiefs, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the
2 bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves; and expose them to the sun and moon and to all the stars, and to all the host of heaven which they loved and served, and after which they went and to which they were attached, and to which they bowed down. They shall not be lamented nor buried; but shall be for a spectacle, on the face of the earth (because they chose death rather than life) even to all the residue left of that generation, in every place whither I shall drive them.

4 Thus saith the Lord, Doth not he who falleth rise again?
5 Or doth not he who turneth aside, return back? Why then hath this my people shamefully turned aside, and persisted in
6 their error and refused to return? Hearken now and hear! Will they not speak thus, "There is not a man who repent-
eth of his wickedness, saying, "What have I done?" He who was running stop'd in his course like a horse tired with whinnying." The stork in the heaven knoweth her season; so doth the dove and the swallow of the field: the ostriches observed the time of their coming; but my people do not know the judgments of the Lord. How can you say, "We are wise and the law of the Lord is with us." In vain was it made; the scribes had a lying pen. Are the wise ashamed? They are indeed dismayed and taken. Because they rejected the law of the Lord; therefore be their wisdom what it may, I will give their wives to others and their fields to them who will take possession, that they may gather the products thereof, saith the Lord.

(c) There is not a cluster on the vine nor is there a fig on the fig trees, even the leaves are fallen. Why sit we still? Assemble and let us go into the fortified cities; and let us be cast off there; since God hath cast us off. He hath indeed given us water of gall to drink because we have sinned against him. We assembled for peace; but there is no good; for a time of healing and behold trouble. From Dan we can hear the sound of the snorting of his horses; with the neighing of his cavalry the whole earth is shaken.

(J) And on he will come and devour the land and the fulness thereof, the cities and them who dwell therein. For behold I am sending against you deadly serpents, which cannot be charmed, and they will bite you with incurable wounds, which shall pain your throbbing heart.

Hark! a sound of the cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land! "Is not the Lord in Sion? Is he not king there?" Because they provoked me to anger with their graven images and with strange vanities.

(p) "The summer is past; the harvest is over and we are not saved," at the destruction of the daughter of my people I was whelmed in darkness: in distress I was seized with pangs like those of a woman in travail. Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why is not healing come for the daughter of my people.

(c) The chorus, the inhabitants of the country. (J) Jehovah. (p) The prophet.
IX. O! that my head were water! and mine eyes a fountain of tears! That I might weep day and night for this people of mine—for the slain of the daughter of my people! O! that I had a remote lodging in the wilderness, that I might leave my people and go away from them!

(J) Because they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men, and have bent their tongue like a bow—lying and infidelity prevailed in the land—because they have proceeded from evils to evils, and have not known me, saith the Lord; be upon your guard every man against his neighbour, and in your own brothers place no confidence; for every brother will supplant, and every friend walk deceitfully; every one will treat his friend with contempt. They cannot speak truth; their tongue hath learned to speak lies. They have done injustice, and have not stopped to rectify it. There is usury upon usury, deceit upon deceit; they refused to know me, saith the Lord: therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I will melt them and try them. What else can I do on account of the wickedness of the daughter of my people? Their tongue is a wounding dart: the words of their mouth are deceitful. To his neighbour one speaketh peace; when inwardly he harboureth enmity. Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord; and on such a nation shall not my soul be avenged? Take ye up a lamentation for the mountains, and for the paths of the wilderness, a song of woe; for such is the desolation that there are no men, nor is there a sound of existence heard from birds of the air, nor from cattle. They were confounded. They are fled.

I will indeed deliver up Jerusalem to captivity and make it a den for jackals; and the cities of Juda an uninhabitable desolation.

(p) Whoever is a wise man, let him understand this; and let him, who hath a word from the mouth of the Lord, declare to you, for what cause the land is destroyed—burned up like a desert, so as not to be travelled.

IV. AGAIN the Lord said to me,
(J) Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them and have not hearkened to my voice: but have gone after the pleasures of their own wicked heart, and after the idols
15 which their fathers taught them; therefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, behold I will feed them with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. And I will scatter them among the nations, which neither they nor their fathers have known, and send a sword after them till they are consumed by it. Thus saith the Lord, Call the mourning women and let them come; send for the well instructed and let them utter a plaintive sound and take up a mournful lamentation for you: and let your eyes collect tears, and your eye lids gush out water.

19 (p) Because a sound of wailing is heard in Sion; "Oh how wretched we are! how greatly confounded because we have left our land, and abandoned our habitations:" hear I beseech you, O women! a word of God: and let your ears receive the words of his mouth: and teach your daughters a song of woe; and every woman, her neighbour the mournful dirge. For death is gone up through your windows: it is come into your land, to destroy infants at home and young men in the streets: and the carcasses of the men shall be for a spectacle on the open field throughout your land, like grass after a mower and there will be none to gather.

23 (J) Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom: nor the mighty man boast of his strength; neither let the rich man boast of his riches: but let him who boasteth, boast of this only, that he understandeth and knoweth, that I am the Lord, who exercise mercy and judgment and justice on the earth: that in these things is my delight, saith the Lord. Behold days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will visit upon all the uncircumcised, their uncircumcisions—

26 Upon Egypt, and upon Idumea, and upon Edom, and upon the Ammonites, and upon the Moabites, and upon all that have their foreheads shaven—namely them who dwell in the wilderness.

Because all the nations are uncircumcised in flesh, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in their hearts; hear the word of the Lord which he hath spoken for you O house of Israel. Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the ways of the nations, and at the signs of heaven be not dismayed, because they are terrified at these appearances, because the ordinances
of the nations are vain. Timber is cut from the forest: a carpenter's work and a molten image are adorned with silver and gold. Having fastened them with mallets and nails they will place them and they are not to be moved. They are silver which can be turned in a lathe; they cannot walk. They are silver which can be formed into plates. From Tharsis will come the gold of Mophaz, and the hand of men skilled in casting gold. They are all the workmanship of artists.

With blue and purple raiment they are to be clothed: They must be taken up and carried; for they cannot walk. Fear them not for they can do you no harm, and there is no good in them. Thus shall you say to them, Let the gods, which have not made heaven and earth, perish from the earth and from under heaven. It is the Lord who made the earth by his power, who established the world by his wisdom: and by his understanding spread out the heaven, and the multitude of waters in heaven: when he brought up clouds from the extremity of the earth; he made the lightning for rain, and brought light forth from his treasuries. Every man on account of knowledge became foolish. Every melter of gold was put to shame for his graven images, because he cast falsities and there is no breath in them. These ridiculous works are vain; in the time of their visitation they shall perish. Unlike to these is the portion of Jacob: for he who formed all things is his inheritance. His name is, The Lord. He hath collected from abroad the substance of thee, dwelling in chosen places. For thus saith the Lord, Behold I am about to subvert with affliction the inhabitants of this land, that the stroke may reach thee.

Alas for thine affliction! the stroke given thee is painful.

(p) Upon this I said, This is a wounding thee indeed! it hath sunk deep in thee! thy tent is in a miserable state. It is ruined. And all thy curtains are torn to pieces.

(c) My children and my flocks are no more. There is not a trace of my tent left—no remains of my curtains.

(J) Because the shepherds were foolish and sought not the Lord, therefore the whole flock was thoughtless and they are scattered. A noisy sound! Hark! it is coming. And a great commotion from the land of the north, to make the cities of Juda a desolation and a haunt of ostriches.
(p) I know, O Lord, that the way of man is not in himself, nor can a man who travelleth ensure to himself a prosperous journey. Correct us, O Lord, but with judgment and not with wrath, that thou mayst not make us few in number.—Pour out thy wrath on the nations that know thee not, and on the families which have not invoked thy name. Because they have devoured Jacob and consumed him, and have made his pasture a desolation.

XI. V. THE word which came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant: and thou shalt speak to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and say to them, Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, Cursed is the man who will not hearken to the words of that covenant which I enjoined on your fathers, at the time when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; out of the iron furnace saying, Hearken to my voice, and do all that I command you: and you shall be my people, and I will be your God; that I may perform the oath which I swore to your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Thereupon I answered and said, So be it, O Lord.

Then the Lord said to me, Read these words in the cities of Juda and in the streets of Jerusalem, and say, Hear the words of this covenant and do them. And when they did not: the Lord said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Juda and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. They have turned back to the iniquities of their fathers, who refused to hearken to my words. And lo they are going after strange gods to serve them. Both the house of Israel and the house of Juda have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers; therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I am bringing upon this people evils, from which they shall not be able to escape. And when they cry to me I will not hearken to them. Let the cities of Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods, to which they burn incense; but which cannot save them in the time of their adversity. Since according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda—and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem, you erected
14 altars to burn incense to Baal; therefore pray not thou for this people, nor intercede for them with supplication and prayer; for I will not hearken when they call on me in the time of their distress.

15 What! my beloved hath committed abomination in my very house! will prayers and holy meats remove from thee thy wickedness? or by means of these shalt thou escape? The Lord called thy name The beautiful shady olive. At the sound of lopping it a fire was kindled against it. Great is the affliction coming upon thee. Its branches are destroyed. The Lord who planted thee hath denounced evils against thee, for the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Juda, for they have brought this upon themselves by burning incense to Baal to provoke me.

18 (p) Inform me, O Lord, and let me know!

19 Then I saw their devices. As for me I like a lamb led to slaughter did not know. Against me they had formed a wicked design, saying, "Come, let us put poison in his bread, and cut him off from the land of the living; and let his name be mentioned no more."

20 O Lord, who judgest righteously, trying reins and hearts! let me see thy vengeance on them, for to thee I have laid open my cause.

21 On this account, thus saith the Lord to the men of Anathoth, who seek my life, who say thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the Lord—if thou dost; thou shalt die by our hand, "Behold I will punish them. Their young men shall die by the sword. And their sons and their daughters shall die by famine. And there shall not be a remnant of them left; for I will bring evils on the inhabitants of Anathoth in the year of their visitation."

XII. (p) Righteous as thou art, O Lord, can I defend a cause against thee? but let me speak to thee in respect to judgments. Why is the way of wicked men prosperous? why are they happy who have been all guilty of perfidy? Thou hast planted them and they have taken root, they have generated and produced fruit. Thou art near in their mouth, but far from their reins. But thou, O Lord, knowest me. Thou hast tried
my heart before thee. Prepare them for the day of their slaughter. How long shall the land mourn, and all the grass of the field be withered, for the wickedness of them who dwell therein? The cattle and fowls are vanished; because they said, God will not regard our ways.

(J) Thy feet run and fail thee: what preparation canst thou make, for horses? In thy land of peace hast thou been secure? how wilt thou act at the swelling of Jordan? since even thy brethren and the house of thy father have dealt perfidiously with thee; when they have raised the cry of war—have assembled in pursuit of thee, wilt thou trust them, because they speak thee fair? I have forsaken my house, I have abandoned my heritage, I have given the beloved of my soul into the hands of her enemies. My heritage became to me like a lion in a forest; against me it roared; therefore I hated it. Is not this heritage of mine the den of a hyena? to me indeed it is the den around her. Go, collect all the beasts of the field and let them come and devour it. Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have defiled my portion, they have made my beloved portion a trackless desert: it is given up to total destruction. On my account the whole land is utterly desolated: because there is not a man who layeth this to heart, against every outlet by the wilderness destroyers are come: because the sword of the Lord devoureth from one end of the land to the other; there is no peace for any flesh. Sow wheat and reap brambles. Their portions shall not profit them. Be ashamed of your boasting, of reproaches against the Lord. For thus saith the Lord, respecting all those malignant neighbours, who touch my inheritance which I parcelled out to my people Israel; behold I am about to pluck them out of their land, and I will drive out Juda from among them, but after I have driven them out, I will return and have compassion on them, and settle them every one in his inheritance even every one in his own land. And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the way of my people to swear by my name, "As the Lord liveth" as they taught my people to swear by Baal; they shall be established among my people: but if they will not return; I will assuredly root out that nation with ruin and destruction.
XIII. VI. Thus saith the Lord, Go and get thee a linen girdle and gird it about thy loins; but it must not be washed with water. And when I had procured the girdle according to the word of the Lord and had girded it about my loins, a word of the Lord came to me saying, Take the girdle which is about thy loins, and arise and go to the Euphrates and hide it there in the hole of the rock. So I went and hid it by the Euphrates as the Lord commanded me. And after many days the Lord said to me, "Arise and go to the Euphrates and take thence the girdle, which I commanded thee to hide there." So I went to the river Euphrates and digged and took the girdle out of the place where I had buried it; and behold it was rotten and good for nothing. Then a word of the Lord came to me saying, Thus saith the Lord, So will I mar the haughtiness of Juda, and the haughtiness of Jerusalem, that great haughtiness—them who refuse to hearken to my words, and have gone after strange gods to serve them and worship them: and they shall be like this girdle which is good for nothing. For as the girdle is tightly bound around the loins of its owner; so did I bind to myself the house of Israel, and the whole house of Juda; that they might be for me a renowned people, and for a boast and for a glory. But they have not hearkened to me. Therefore thou shalt say to this people, "Every leathern bottle is to be filled with wine." And if they say to thee, Do we not know very well that every leathern bottle is to be filled with wine? Then thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord, Behold I will fill the inhabitants of this land, both their kings who are seated as sons of David on their thrones, and the priests and the prophets, even Juda and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness. And I will scatter them, their heads of families and their brethren, both fathers and their sons at the same time. I will not have compassion saith the Lord, nor will I spare, nor pity them for their destruction.

(p) Hearken and give ear and be not elated; for the Lord hath spoken, Give glory to the Lord your God, before the darkness cometh, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains; when you will wait for light; and the shadow of death will be there; and they shall be placed in darkness. But if you will not hearken, your soul shall weep in secret for your
haughtiness; and tears shall gush from your eyes; because the flock of the Lord is destroyed.

18 (J) Say to the king and the rulers, Humble yourselves and sit on the ground; for from your head is taken your crown of glory. The cities of the south shall be shut up and there shall be none to open. Juda is removed; they have made a complete removal. Raise thine eyes, O Jerusalem, and see them who are coming from the north! Where is the flock that was given thee—the flock of thy glory? What wilt thou say, when these visit thee? seeing thou thyself hast taught them against thyself lessons for government. Will not pangs seize thee as a woman in travail? Now shouldst thou say in thy heart, "Why have such things befallen me?" For the greatness of thine iniquity, thy back is uncovered that thy heels may be exposed to view! Will an Ethiopian change his skin and a leopard her spots? As for you then, will you who have learned these evils be able to do good? Therefore I have scattered them like stubble whirled by wind to a desert; this then shall be thy lot and portion for your disobeying me, saith the Lord. As thou hast forgotten me and trusted in lies; I therefore will expose thee naked to view that thy shame may be seen—namely thy adultery and thy neighing and the lewdness of thy whoredom. On the mounts and in the fields I have seen thine abominations. Alas for thee, Jerusalem, because thou hast not purified thyself to follow me. How much longer will it be before thou wilt?

XIV. VII. THERE came also to Jeremias a word of the Lord concerning the drought. Judea mourned and her gates were deserted: and darkness overspread the land and the cry of Jerusalem ascended. When her nobles sent their underlings for water; they went to the wells and found no water and returned with their vessels empty. A stop was put to the works of the field, because there was no rain. The husbandmen were confounded; they covered their heads. The hinds calved in the field and left their young, because there was not a plant. The wild asses stood in the forests and snuffed up the wind: their eyes failed because there was no grass.

7 Our sins have risen up against us. O Lord, deal with us
for thine own sake: for our sins are many in thy sight—for we have sinned against thee. Thou, O Lord, art the hope of Israel, and savest in time of troubles. Why art thou become as a stranger in the land—as a traveller turning aside for a lodging? Wilt thou be like a man asleep or like a head of a family who cannot save? as thou, O Lord, art among us and we are called by thy name, O! do not forget us. Thus saith the Lord to this people,

(J) They have loved to wander and did not refrain, therefore God hath not prospered their ways, he will now remember their iniquity. (p) Then the Lord said to me, pray not for the prosperity of this people; for though they fast I will not hear their prayer; and though they offer whole burnt offerings and sacrifices, I will not accept them. For with sword, and with famine, and with pestilence, I will utterly consume them. Thereupon I said, O self-existent Lord! behold their prophets prophesy and say, "You shall not see the sword; nor shall there be famine among you. For I will give truth and peace in this land and in this very place."

Then the Lord said to me, These prophets prophesy falsehood in my name; I did not send them, nor command them, nor did I speak to them. Because they prophesy to you lying visions and divinations, and auguries, and the devices of their own hearts; therefore thus saith the Lord concerning those prophets, who prophesy falsehoods in my name, and who say (though I did not send them) "There shall be no sword nor famine in this land," they shall die a direful death and by famine these prophets shall be consumed. And the people to whom they prophesy, with their wives and their sons and their daughters, shall, by reason of the sword and the famine, be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, and there shall be none to bury them, when I pour out these evils on them. Therefore thou shalt deliver to them this word, "Collect tears for your eyes day and night and let them not fail; for with a bruise the daughter of my people is bruised, and the wound is exceedingly painful."

(p) If I go out into the field, behold the slain of the sword! and if I go into the city; behold the distress of famine! seeing priest and prophet are gone to a land which they knew not:
19 hast thou utterly rejected Juda and is thy soul alienated from Sion? Why hast thou smitten us, and there is no cure for us? We waited for peace, and there was no good; for a time of healing, and behold trouble! We acknowledge, O Lord, our sins and the iniquities of our fathers—that we have sinned against thee. O be appeased for thy name’s sake. Destroy not the throne of thy glory; remember, O dissolve not thy covenant with us. Is there any among the idols of the nations who can give rain? and if the heaven shed its abundance, art thou not he who causeth it. Therefore we will wait on thee, O Lord, for thou hast done all these things.

XV. Then the Lord said to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, my soul is not towards them. Send away this people and let them go. And if they say to thee, “Whither shall we go?” then thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord, such as are for pestilence, to pestilence, and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for famine, to famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity. For I will send against them four kinds of avengers, saith the Lord, the sword to slay; and the dogs to tear; and the wild beasts of the earth, and the birds of the air to devour and destroy. And I will deliver them up to distress in all the kingdoms of the earth, on account of Manasses son of Ezekias king of Juda—for all that he did in Jerusalem. Who will pity thee, Jerusalem? or who will bemoan thee? or who will turn aside to inquire after thy welfare? Thou hast turned thy back on me, saith the Lord: backwards thou shalt go. And I will stretch forth my hand and destroy thee. I will no longer bear with them; but utterly disperse them. In the gates of my people they are bereaved of children; my people are destroyed because of their wickedness. Their widows are multiplied above the sand of the sea. Against a mother I have brought soldiers—misery at noon-day. Upon her I have cast suddenly terror and consternation. She who was the mother of seven is childless; her soul is afflicted, the sun set upon her while it is yet mid-day; she is ashamed and confounded: the rest of them I will deliver up to the sword before their enemies.

(p) Wo is me, O my mother, what sort of a person hast thou bore me! a man of strife and contending with all this
land! I have neither lent on usury: nor hath any one lent to me; yet my strength is spent among them who curse me.—
11 Be it so, O Lord, while they enjoy prosperity.
    (J) Did I not stand by thee, in the time of their calamities and in the time of their affliction, for good with the enemy?
12 Shall the sword be felt and thy strength be a coat of mail?
13 Thy treasures indeed I will give for a spoil in all thy borders,
14 as a ransom for all thy sins; and I will make thee a slave to thine enemies around in the land which thou hast not known. For a fire is kindled from my wrath and against you it shall blaze.
15 (p) O Lord, remember me and visit me and save me from them, who are persecuting me past forbearance. Consider how I have for thy sake borne reproach from them who de-
16 spise thy words. Bring them to an end. But let thy word be
17 to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart. Because I am called by thy name, O Lord Almighty, I did not sit in the council of those scorners; but was struck with awe because of thy
18 hand. I sat alone because I was full of bitterness. Why do they who grieve me prevail over me? My wound is deep, how can I be healed? It is indeed become to me like deceitful water which cannot be trusted.
19 (J) Therefore thus saith the Lord, If thou wilt return I will reinstate thee; and in my presence thou shalt stand. And if thou wilt lead out the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth; and they shall turn to thee and thou shalt not
20 turn to them. And I will make thee to this people like a strong wall of brass: though they fight against thee, they shall not pre-
21 vail over thee; for I am with thee to save thee and rescue thee out of the hand of the wicked. And I will redeem thee out of XVI. the hand of pestilent men. But thou must not take a wife, saith the Lord God of Israel: nor shall a son or a daugh-
3 ter be born to thee in this place. For thus saith the Lord concerning the sons, and concerning the daughters born in this place, and concerning the mothers who bare them, and concern-
4 ing their fathers who begot them in this land; by a direful death they shall die; they shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried; they shall be for a spectacle on the face of the earth; they shall be for the wild beasts of the earth, and the birds of
the air. By the sword they shall fall, and by famine they shall be consumed. Thus saith the Lord, Join not in their funeral entertainments; go not to make lamentation nor bewail them. Since I have taken away my peace from this people, no lamentation shall be made for them; nor shall any cut themselves nor be shaved. There shall neither be bread broken in their mourning, to comfort them for the dead; nor shall a cup of consolation be given to any one for his father or mother. Into a house of feasting thou shalt not enter, to sit with them to eat and to drink: for thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, behold I am about to remove out of this place, before your eyes and in these your days, the sound of joy and the sound of mirth, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.

Now when thou hast proclaimed to this people all these words and they say to thee, "Why hath the Lord denounced against us all these evils? What is our iniquity? And what is our sin which we have committed against the Lord our God? Then thou shalt say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the Lord, and have run after strange gods and served them and worshipped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law; and you have done evil worse than your fathers; and lo! you walk every one after the desires of your wicked heart, that you may not hearken to me: therefore I will hurl you out of this land, into a land which neither you nor your fathers knew; and you shall there serve strange gods which will shew you no mercy: therefore behold the days are coming, saith the Lord, when they shall no more say, "As the Lord liveth who brought up the Israelites out of the land of Egypt: but, as the Lord liveth, who brought up the house of Israel from the north, and from all the countries to which they were driven;" for I will bring them again to their land which I gave to their fathers. Behold I will send many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them: and after that I will send many hunters and they shall hunt them, on every mountain and every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks. Because mine eyes are on all their ways, and their iniquities are not hid from mine eyes; therefore I will doubly requite them for their wickedness and their sins
— for their having defiled my land with the carcasses of their abominations, and for their acts of iniquity with which they have caused my heritage to transgress.

19 (p) O Lord, thou art my strength and my help, and my refuge in days of affliction. To thee nations will come from the extremity of the earth and say, What lying idols did our fathers possess! there is no advantage in them. If a man make gods for himself, they are indeed no gods.

21 (J) For this purpose behold! I will at that time manifest my hand to them and make known to them my power, XVII. 5 and they shall know that my name is The Lord. Cursed is the man whose hope is on man—who shall fix the flesh of his arm on him, and whose heart hath departed from the Lord. He shall be like the wild myrtle in the desert. He shall not see when good cometh; but shall dwell in parched places and in a desert—in a salt land which is uninhabited. But blessed is the man who hath trusted in the Lord; and whose hope is the Lord. He will be like a thriving tree near waters which shall shoot out its roots in a moist soil. It will not be afraid when heat cometh, though its stock be loaded with branches. In a year of drought it will not be afraid, nor will it fail to bear fruit.

9 (p) The heart is deep beyond all things; so also is a man, who then can know him?

10 (J) I the Lord search hearts and try reins, to give to every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his devices. A partridge whistled and collected young which it did not bring forth, increasing its wealth but not with judgment; in the midst of its days they will leave it, and at its end it will be a fool.

12 (p) Our sanctuary is an exalted throne of glory. Thou, O Lord art the hope of Israel. Let all who forsake thee be ashamed; let them who have apostatised be enrolled in the dust, because they have forsaken the Lord the fountain of life. Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed. Save me, and I shall be saved. Because thou art my boast, behold they say to me, "Where is the word of the Lord? Let it come. As for me, I was not weary of following thee, nor did I desire the day of a man: thou knowest. The words which pass my lips are before thee; be not estranged from me. Spare me in an
18 evil day. Let my persecutors be ashamed; but let me not be shamed. Let them be dismayed: but let not me be dismayed. Bring upon them an evil day. Crush them with a double crush.

19 VIII. (J) THUS saith the Lord, Go and stand in the gates of the children of thy people at which the kings of Juda come in and at which they go out, even at all the gates of Jerusalem, and thou shalt say to them, Hear the word of the Lord, O kings of Juda and all Juda and all Jerusalem, who enter in by these gates! Thus saith the Lord, Take heed to yourselves and carry no burdens on the sabbath day; nor go out of the gates of Jerusalem. Neither carry burdens out of your houses on the sabbath day nor do any work. Hallow the sabbath day as I commanded your fathers. Though they did not hearken, though they did not incline their ear, but stiffened their necks more than their fathers, that they might not hearken to me nor receive instruction; yet if you will hearken to me, saith the Lord, and not carry burdens through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day by doing no work thereon; there shall enter in at the gates of this city, kings and chiefs seated on the throne of David and riding in chariots and on horses, they and their chiefs, the men of Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall be inhabited for the age. And there shall come from the cities of Juda and from around Jerusalem and from the land of Benjamin and from the plain and from the mountain and from the country to the south, people bringing whole burnt offerings and sacrifices and incense and fine flour and frankincense—bringing offerings of thanksgivings to the house of the Lord. But if you will not hearken to me to hallow the sabbath day, so as not to carry burdens nor come in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day, I will kindle a fire in the gates thereof and it shall consume the streets of Jerusalem and shall not be quenched.

XVIII. IX. THE word which came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying, "Arise and go down to the house of the potter and there thou shalt hear my words." So I went down to the house
of the potter; and behold he was making a piece of work on stones; and the vessel, which he was fashioning with his hands, fell, whereupon he again made it a vessel of another sort as it seemed good to him to make it. Then a word of the Lord came to me saying, Cannot I do with you, O house of Israel, as this potter? Behold you are in my hands like the clay of the potter. When I speak to a nation or kingdom, that I will remove and destroy them; if that nation turn from all their evils, I will relent in respect to the evils which I was resolving to bring on them. And when I speak to a nation and kingdom that I will build up and replant: If they do evil in my sight so as not to hearken to my voice, I indeed will alter my mind in respect to the good things which I spoke of doing for them.

Now I have said to the men of Juda and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Behold I am preparing evils against you and forming against you a determination; turn therefore every one from his evil way and make better things the objects of your pursuit: but they said, We will act like men. We will follow our own courses; and what every one findeth agreeable to his own wicked heart that we will do. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Inquire among the nations. Who hath heard of such horrible things as the virgin of Israel hath sedulously done? Will crags forsake a rock or snow quit Libanus? Or water turn aside when furiously driven by wind? Because my people have forgotten me—have burned incense to vanity; they will therefore break down the everlasting barriers in their ways that they may walk in paths having no road for travelling—that they may make the land a desolation—an everlasting object of pity. All that pass through it shall be astonished and shake their head. Like a burning wind I will scatter them before their enemies. I will shew them the day of their destruction.

Upon this they said, Come let us settle an account with Jeremias. Because law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel i ... the wise, nor a word from the prophet, Come and that we may smite him with the tongue, let us hear all his words.

Hear me, O Lord, and hearken to my justification. Shall
20 evils be returned for good offices? Because they contrived designs against my life and concealed the punishment they intended for me. Remember how I stood before thee to intercede for them—to turn away thy wrath from them. For this cause deliver up their sons to famine and give them up in multitudes to the sword. Let their wives become childless and widows; and the husbands be cut off by pestilence and their young men fall by the sword in battle. Let a scream be heard in their houses. Thou wilt bring robbers suddenly on them because they contrived a speech to entrap me and concealed the snares they had set for me. Thou indeed, O Lord, knewest all their designs against me to put me to death. Absolve them not from their wickedness, nor blot out their sins from before thee. Let their weakness be before thee. Deal with them in the time of thy wrath.

XIX. Then the Lord said to me, Go and get a pitcher of earthen ware and thou shalt take out some of the elders of the people and of the priests and go out to the common graveyard which is at the entrance of the gate Charseith and read there all these words which I shall speak to thee and thou shalt say to them,

3 Hear the word of the Lord, ye kings of Juda and ye men of Juda and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and ye who enter in at these gates. Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, Behold I am bringing evils upon this place, so that the ears of every one who heareth them shall tingle. Because they have forsaken me and profaned this place; and have burned incense in it to strange gods, which neither they nor their fathers knew; and the kings of Juda have filled this place with the blood of innocents; and have built high places to Baal to burn their sons with fire, things which I never commanded, and which never came into my mind; therefore behold the days are coming, saith the Lord, When this place shall no more be called, "The end of hope," and "The graveyard of the sons of Ennom;" but "The graveyard of slaughter." For I will slaughter the council of Juda and the council of Jerusalem in this place; And cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them who seek their lives. And I will give their carcasses to be meat for the birds of the air and the wild beasts
8 of the earth, and make this city a desolation and an object of pity. Every one who passeth by it shall be sad and express the sound of pity for the stroke which it hath received. They shall indeed eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters; and they shall eat, every one, the flesh of his neighbour, in the blockade and siege with which their enemies shall besiege them.

10 Then thou shalt break the pitcher before the eyes of the men who went out with thee and say, Thus saith the Lord, So will I break this people and this city: as this earthen pitcher is broken and cannot be mended, so will I do, saith the Lord, to this place and to the inhabitants thereof, that this city may be dashed down like that hopeless vessel. And the houses of the kings of Juda shall be like this hopeless place, because of their impurities in all the houses on the tops of which they burned incense to all the host of heaven and poured out libations to strange gods.

14 Now when Jeremias returned from the grave yard whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy, he stood up in the court of the house of the Lord and said to all the people, Thus saith the Lord, Behold I am bringing upon this city and upon all the cities belonging to it and upon all the villages thereof all the evils which I have denounced against it, because they have hardened their necks so as not to hearken to my commandments. Whereupon Paschor son of Emmer, the priest who was appointed ruler of the house of the Lord, when he heard Jeremias prophesying these words, smote him and committed him to the prison which was in the upper story of the gate to the house of the Lord. And when Paschor took Jeremias out of prison, Jeremias said to him, He hath not called thy name Paschor, but Exile. For thus saith the Lord, Behold I will send thee with all thy friends into exile; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies and thine eyes shalt see it. I will deliver thee and all Juda into the hands of the king of Babylon; and they shall be exiled and slain with swords. And I will deliver all the strength of this city and all the labours thereof and all the treasures of the king of Juda into the hands of his enemies and they shall carry them to Babylon.

6 And thou and all that dwell in thy house shall go into cap-
tivity and thou shalt die in Babylon and be buried there, thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophesied falsehoods.

7 (p) Hast thou, O Lord deceived me? and have I been deceived? Thou hast taken hold and hast prevailed. I am become a subject of laughter: all the day long I endure reproach. Because for my bitter word I am to be derided, shall I appeal to

8 a breach of covenant and misery? because the word of the Lord became a reproach to me—a subject of mockery all the

9 day long; therefore I said, I will not name the name of the Lord—I will not speak any more in his name. But there was

10 kindled as it were a burning fire in my bones and I became dejected and cannot bear it. Because I heard the whisper of many collected from all around saying, "Join in conspiracy and let us all conspire against him; ye men who are his friends watch his thoughts; if he can be deceived, we shall then pre-

11 vail over him and take our revenge on him." But the Lord was with me as a mighty warrior, therefore they persecuted and could not contrive. They were put to great confusion.

Because they had not a due sense of their infamous practi-

12 ces, which are never to be forgotten; O Lord, who provest righteous things, who knowest reins and hearts I might have seen thy vengeance on them. For to thee I laid open my cause.

13 Sing to the Lord; sing praises to him, because he hath rescued the soul of the needy out of the hand of evil doers. "Let the day be cursed in which I was born—the day in which my mother bore me; Let it not be mentioned with expressions of joy. Let the man be cursed who brought tidings to my father saying, A male child is borne to thee making him glad.

16 Let that man be like the cities which the Lord overthrew in wrath and relented not, Let him hear a scream in the morning and the cry of woe at noon-day, because he did not kill me in the womb, and my mother was not made my grave, and her

17 womb always with child." To what purpose this? I came forth from the womb to see labours and sorrows, and my days have been spent in shame.

XXII. X. Thus saith the Lord, Go down to the house of the king of Juda and thou shalt speak there this word and say, Hear a word of the Lord, O king of Juda, who art seated on the
throne of David, thou and thy household and thy people and they who enter in at these gates! Thus saith the Lord, Execute judgment and justice and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of him who wrongeth him; and over the stranger and the orphan and the widow tyrannise not; nor be guilty of impiety; nor shed innocent blood in this place. For if you faithfully execute this charge, there shall enter in at the gates of this house, kings seated on the throne of David and riding in chariots and on horses, they and their servants and their people. But if you will not perform these things, by myself I have sworn, saith the Lord, This house shall be a desolation. For thus saith the Lord against the house of the king of Juda, though thou wert to me as Galaad, as the top of Libanus, I will make thee a desolation, cities uninhabitable. I will indeed bring against thee a destroyer, a man with his axe; and they shall cut down thy choice cedars and throw them into the fire. And when nations shall pass by this city, they will say, every one to his neighbour, "Why hath the Lord dealt thus with this great city?" To which it will be said in reply, "Because they forsook the Lord their God and worshipped strange gods and served them."

Weep not for him who is dead, nor utter lamentations for him, weep bitterly for him who is going away; for he shall never return, nor see any more his native country. For thus saith the Lord respecting Sellem son of Josias, who reigned in the room of his father and who is gone from this place; he shall not return hither any more: but in the place to which I have transported him, there he shall die and this land he shall see no more.

With regard to him who is building himself a house, but not with righteousness, and lofty stories, but not with justice: he useth the service of his neighbour for nothing, and will not pay him his wages. Thou hast built thyself a well proportioned house, lofty chambers well fitted with windows, and cieled with cedar and painted with vermillion. Is it thy desire to be made king? because thou art instigated by thy father Achaz, are there not feasts? are there not entertainments? better were it for thee to execute judgment and justice. They did not take cognisance, they did not administer justice to the lowly, nor decide righteously the cause of the needy, is not this ow-
17 ing to thy not knowing me? saith the Lord. Behold thine eyes are not good, neither is thy heart; but they are bent upon thine inordinate desires and on the shedding of innocent blood, and on injustice, and on murder; that thou mayst perpetrate these things.

18 Therefore thus saith the Lord respecting Joakim son of Josias, king of Juda, even concerning this man, they shall not utter for him the lamentation "Alas Brother," nor shall they bewail him saying, "Alas lord." He shall be buried with the burial of an ass—being blotted out he shall be cast forth without the gates of Jerusalem. Ascend Libanus and scream: ascend Basan, and shout. Shout till thy voice reach the sea coast; for all thy lovers are destroyed. I spake to thee respecting thy fall; but thou saidst, "I will not listen." This hath been thy way from thy youth, thou hast not hearkened to my voice. All thy shepherds shall be fed with wind; and all thy lovers shall go into captivity; that thou mayst then be ashamed and confounded on the account of them who love thee. O inhabitant of Lebanon, who hast thy nest in the cedars, thou shalt groan bitterly when pangs come upon thee like those of a woman in travail: as I live saith the Lord though Jechonias may be made a son of Joakim, a king of Juda, a signet on my right hand I will drag thee out thence and deliver thee into the hands of them who seek thy life—of them whose countenance thou dreadest—into the hands of the Chaldeans. And I will cast out thee and the mother who brought thee forth, into a land where thou wast not born, and there thou shalt die. Into the land which their souls long for they shall not return. Jechonias is dishonoured like a vessel which is useless, because he is hurled away and cast into a land which he knew not. O earth, earth, hear a word of the Lord! record the chieftain himself as a man of low rank, exiled by the voice of a herald; for no increase from his seed shall sit on the throne of David, nor any more be chief in Juda.

XXIII. XI. HA! the shepherds are destroying and scattering the sheep of their pasture. Therefore thus saith the Lord to the shepherds of my people, You have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not watched them; behold I will punish you according to your malignant doings. And I
will gather the remains of my people in every land whither I have driven them and bring them back to their own pasture and they shall increase and multiply. And I will raise up shepherds for them who will feed them. And they shall no more be terrified nor affrighted, saith the Lord.

Behold the days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will raise up for David a righteous shoot, who shall reign king and understand and execute judgment and justice on the earth. In his days Juda shall be saved and Israel shall dwell securely. And the name which the Lord will give him by the prophets shall be Josedek [Lord of righteousness.]

(p) My heart within me was broken. All my bones quivered. I was like a man sore bruised and like a man staggering with wine, at the presence of the Lord, and at the comeliness of his glory; because on account of them the land mourned and the pastures of the wilderness were parched up—because their course was bad and suitably thereto their strength.

(J) Because priest and prophet are polluted, and in my house I have seen their wickedness; let their way therefore be slippery and dark, that they may stumble and fall therein. For I will bring evils upon them in the year of their visitation.

Among the prophets of Samaria I saw indeed unlawful doings—they prophesied in the name of Baal and led my people Israel astray: but among the prophets of Jerusalem I saw horrible things—some committing adultery, and some walking in lies, and some strengthening the hands of the multitude, that none might turn from his evil way. To me they are all become like Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof like Gomorrah: therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I will feed them with wormwood, and give them the water of gall to drink. Because from the prophets of Jerusalem pollution has gone forth through all the land, thus saith the Lord Almighty, Hearken not to the words of these prophets; for they contrive for themselves a foolish vision: they speak from their own hearts and not from the mouth of the Lord. They say to them who reject the word of the Lord, "You shall have peace." Even to all who are walking by their own desires, and to every one walking in the error of his own heart they say, "Evils shall not come upon thee. For which of them hath stood in the council
of the Lord and seen? who hath hearkened and heard his voice?" Behold a tempest from the Lord and wrath like a hurricane is issuing forth: it will come like a whirlwind upon the wicked; and from the purpose of his heart the wrath of the Lord will not turn away; until it hath executed it; and until he hath established it. In the last of these days they shall perceive this. I did not send these prophets, but they ran of themselves; I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied. Now had they stood in the firm belief of me and heard my word, they might have turned my people from their wicked pursuits. I am God when near, saith the Lord; and am I not God when far off? Can any one hide himself in secret places; and I not see him? Do I not fill the heaven and the earth? saith the Lord. I have heard what these prophets speak—what they prophesy in my name, saying falsely, "I have dreamed a dream." How long shall it be in the heart of these prophets, who prophesy lies, that by prophesying the desires of their own hearts—they may count upon causing my name to be forgotten, by their dreams which they tell, every one to his neighbour; as their fathers forgot my name by using Baal? Let the prophet, who hath a dream, tell his dream: and let him, to whom my word cometh, declare it with truth. Why is the chaff added to the wheat? Is not this the case with my words? saith the Lord. Behold are not my words like fire? saith the Lord; and like a sledge which breaketh a rock? Therefore behold I am against those prophets, saith the Lord, who steal my words every one from his neighbour. Behold I am against those prophets, who belch forth prophecies of the tongue and drowse their dozy drowsings: therefore behold I am against those prophets who prophesy false dreams. Have they not told them and led my people astray by their lies and their errors? As for me, I neither sent them nor commanded them; therefore they cannot in any wise benefit this people. Now if this people or a priest or a prophet should ask, "What is the burden of the Lord?" Thou shalt say to them, "You are that burden and I will cast you off, saith the Lord." As for the prophet and the priests and the people who say, "The burden of the Lord;" I will punish that man and his house. Thus you shall say every one to his neighbour and every one to his brother, "What hath the Lord answered,"
36 and, "What hath the Lord spoken." So mention no more the burden of the Lord: since every man's word shall be his burden. "But why hath the Lord our God spoken?" For this cause, saith the Lord our God, because you have used this expression, "The Burden of the Lord," though I sent to you saying, You shall not say, "The Burden of the Lord." Therefore behold I will take and dash down you and this city which I gave to you and your fathers; and I will bring upon you everlasting reproach, and everlasting dishonour which shall not be forgotten.

XXVI. XII. In the beginning of the reign of Joakim son of Josias, this word came from the Lord.

2 Thus saith the Lord, Stand in the court of the house of the Lord and thou shalt solemnly pronounce to all the Jews and to all who come to worship in the house of the Lord all the words which I have commanded thee to prophesy to them; keep not back a word. Perhaps they may hearken and turn every one from his evil way, that I may refrain from all the evils which I am resolving to do to them, because of their wicked pursuits. And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, Unless you hearken to me so as to walk by the ordinances which I have set before you; and hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you, whom I, rising early, have sent to you, though you have not hearkened to them; I will make this house like Selo; and this city I will make a curse for all the nations of the whole earth.

7 So the priests and the false prophets and all the people heard Jeremias pronouncing these words in the house of the Lord. And when Jeremias had done speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to deliver to all the people; the priests and the false prophets and all the people seized him, saying, Thou shalt be put to death, because thou hast prophesied in the name of the Lord saying, "This house shall be like Selo, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitants." And all the people were assembled against Jeremias in the house of the Lord. When the chiefs of Juda heard the affair, they went up from the king's house to the house of the Lord and sat down in the vestibule of the new gate. And the priests and the false prophets addressed the chiefs, and said to all the
people, Let sentence of death pass on this man, because he hath prophesied against this city as you have heard with your ears. Whereupon Jeremias addressing the chiefs, spoke to all the people saying, The Lord hath sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city, all the words which you have heard. Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and hearken to the voice of the Lord; and the Lord will refrain from all the evils which he hath denounced against you. As for me, behold I am in your hands. Do with me as seemeth good and best to you. But be assured that if you put me to death, you bring innocent blood on yourselves and upon this city and upon the inhabitants thereof. For in truth, the Lord hath sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.

Then the chiefs and all the people said to the priests and the false prophets, This man is not liable to death, for he hath spoken to us in the name of the Lord. And there stood up some principal men of the elders of the land, and said to all the assembly of the people, Michaiaas the Morasthite lived in the days of Ezekias king of Juda, and he said to all the people of Juda, "Thus said the Lord, Sion shall be ploughed like a field; and Jerusalem shall be a desolation; and the mountain of this house, a grove of a forest:" but did Ezekias and all Juda put him to death? No. Because they feared the Lord; and because they intreated the favour of the Lord: therefore the Lord refrained from the evils which he had denounced against them. Now as for us, we have committed great evils against our souls.

Now there was a man who prophesied in the name of the Lord, namely Ourias son of Samaias of Kariathiarim; and he prophesied against this land according to all the words of Jeremias. And when king Joakim and all the chiefs heard all his words, and sought to kill him and Ourias heard it, he fled to Egypt. And the king sent men to Egypt, who fetched him out thence and brought him to the king; and he slew him with the sword and threw him into the common grave yard. But the hand of Achikam son of Saphan was with Jeremias that they should not deliver him up into the hands of the people, nor kill him.
XXV. XIII. THE word which came to Jeremias concerning all the people of Juda in the fourth year of Joakim son of Josias king of Juda, which he spoke to all the people of Juda and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,

3 (J) From the thirteenth year of Josias son of Amos king of Juda even to this day, for three and twenty years I have spoken to you rising early and speaking: and I have sent to you my servants the prophets; rising early and sending them, though you have not hearkened nor inclined your ears; saying, Turn ye every one from his evil way, and from your wicked pursuits and you shall dwell in this land, which I gave to you and your fathers from age to age. Go not after strange gods to serve them, and worship them, that you may not provoke me by the works of your hands to bring evils upon you. But you hearkened not to me. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Since you have not believed my words, behold I am sending, and I will take a family from the north and bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all the nations around it. And I will lay them waste and make them a desolation and an object of pity and an everlasting reproach. And I will destroy from among them the sound of joy and the sound of gladness; the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; the odour of myrrh and the light of the lamp. And the whole country shall be a desolation. And they shall be slaves among the nations seventy years. And when the seventy years are compleated I will execute vengeance on that nation, and make them an everlasting desolation. I will indeed bring against that land all these words of mine which I have spoken against it—all the things which are written in this book which Jeremias prophesied against the nations, in the manner the Lord, the God of Israel said, "Take this cup of wine—this strong wine from my hand, and thou shalt make all the nations, to which I send thee, drink it. And they shall drink and vomit and rave, because of the sword which I send among them. So I took the cup out of the hand of the Lord and made all the nations drink to which the Lord sent me, namely Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, and the kings of Juda, and his chiefs, to make them a desolation and a waste and an object of pity; also Pharao king of Egypt and his servants
and his nobles and all his people; and all the mixed people; 20 and all the kings of the Philistines, (namely Ascalon and Gaza 21 and Akkaron and the remnant of Azotus;) and Idumea and 22 Moab and the children of Ammon; and the kings of Tyre and the kings of Sidon; and the kings on the border of the 23 sea; and Daidan and Thaiman and Ros, and all that had their 24 foreheads shaven; and all the mixed people who dwell in the 25 desert; and all the kings of Ailam and all the kings of the 26 Persians and all the kings north of the sun, far and near, every one adjoining his brother, even all the kingdoms on the face 27 of the earth. And thou shalt say to them, Thus said the Lord Almighty, Drink and be drunk, and you shall vomit, and fall and rise no more because of the sword which I send among you.

28 And if they refuse to take the cup out of thy hand to drink, then thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, You shall drink it: 29 for in the city which is called by my name I am beginning to inflict calamity and with purification you shall not be purified; for I am calling for a sword against all the inhabitants of the 30 earth. Therefore thou shalt prophesy against them all these words and say; The Lord from on high will solemnly pronounce sentence from his sanctuary; he will utter his voice—in his place he will utter a triumphant shout and some like the treaders of grapes will answer. When destruction hath come on the inhabitants of this land—upon a part of the earth; because the Lord hath a controversy with the nations, he will come to judgment with all flesh; and the wicked shall be given up to the 32 sword, saith the Lord; Thus saith the Lord, Behold evils are coming from nation to nation. A mighty tempest is issuing 33 forth from the extremity of the earth, and the slain of the Lord shall be in the day of the Lord from one end of the earth to the other. They shall not be buried. They shall be 34 for dung on the face of the earth. Raise the mournful cry, ye shepherds; utter loud moans and lamentations, ye rams of the flock; for the days for your slaughter are accomplished, and 35 ye shall fall like choice rams; and the shepherds shall have no 36 way to flee, nor the rams of the flock to escape. Hark! a sound of the shepherds' screaming! and a doleful bleating of the sheep and the rams! For the Lord hath utterly destroyed their
37 pastures and because of his fierce anger he will put an end to
38 the remains of peace. Like a lion he hath quitted his covert; therefore their land is become a trackless desert by reason of the mighty sword.

XXXVI. XIV. IN the fourth year of Joakim son of Josias king of Juda, a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the words which I have spoken to thee against Jerusalem and against Juda and against all the nations from the day I first spoke to thee—from the days of Josias king of Juda even to this day. Perhaps the house of Juda will hear all the evils which I purpose to do to them, that they may turn from their evil way and that I may be merciful to their iniquities and their sins. Thereupon Jeremias sent for Baruch, son of Nerias, and he wrote in a book, from the mouth of Jeremias, all the words which the Lord had spoken to him. Then Jeremias gave a charge to Baruch, saying, I am watched so that I cannot go to the house of the Lord; therefore thou shalt read from this roll in the hearing of the people in the house of the Lord on the fast day, even in the hearing of all Juda who come from their cities thou shalt read to them. Perhaps they may find favour in the sight of the Lord and turn from their evil way, for great is the wrath and the anger of the Lord which he hath denounced against this people.

8 So Baruch did according to all that Jeremias commanded him, that he might read from the book the words of the Lord in the house of the Lord. And it came to pass that in the eighth year of the reign of Joakim, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and the house of Juda kept a solemn fast before the Lord. And Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremias in the house of the Lord in the house of Gamarias son of Saphan the scribe, in the upper court at the vestibule of the new gate of the house of the Lord and in the hearing of all the people. And when Michaias son of Gamarias son of Saphan heard all the words of the Lord from the book, he went down to the king's house, to the house of the secretary; and lo! all the chiefs were there in council, namely, Elisama the secretary, and Dalias son of Selemias, and Jonathan son of Achobar and
Gamarias son of Saphan and Sedekias son of Ananias and all the chiefs. And when Michaias told them all the words which he had heard, which Baruch read in the hearing of the people, all the chiefs sent Judin son of Nathanias son of Selemias, son of Chusi to Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the roll thou art reading to the people and come. Accordingly Baruch took the roll and went down to them. And they said to him, Read it again to us. So Baruch read it. And when they had heard all the words, they consulted, and said one to another, We must certainly inform the king of all these words. Then they questioned Baruch and said, Where didst thou write all these words? And Baruch said, From his mouth. Jeremias dictated to me all these words and I wrote them in a book. Then they said to Baruch, Go and hide, both thou and Jeremias and let no man know where you are. Then they went to court to the king, but left the roll in safe keeping in the house of Elisamas and they told the king all the words. And the king sent Judin for the book. And Judin having brought it from the house of Elisamas read it in the hearing of the king and in the hearing of all the chiefs who were standing round the king.

Now the king was sitting in the winter house and there was a grate with fire in it before him. So as Judin read three or four folds, he cut them off with the secretary's knife and threw them into the fire in the grate, till the whole roll was consumed in the fire. But neither the king nor his servants, who heard all these words, made any inquiry nor rent their clothes. Nay Elnathan and Godolias suggested to the king to burn the roll. Then the king commanded Jeremeel the king's son and Saraias son of Esriel to apprehend Baruch and Jeremias. But they had hid themselves.

And after the king had burned the roll—all the words which Baruch had written from the mouth of Jeremias, a word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying, Take thee another roll and write all the words which were in that roll which king Joakim hath burned, and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, Thou hast burned that roll, saying, "Why hast thou written therein and said the king of Babylon shall surely come and lay waste this land, so that neither man nor beast shall be left there-in," therefore thus said the Lord respecting Joakim king of
Juda, He shall not have one to sit on the throne of David; and his carcass shall be exposed to the heat of the day and to the frost of the night: and I will keep a watch upon him and upon his family and upon his servants and bring upon him and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the land of Juda all the evils which I have denounced against them and to which they have not hearkened.

So Baruch took another roll and wrote thereon from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the book which Joakim had burned and to it were added more words similar to them.

The word which came to Jeremias from the Lord in the days of Joakim king of Juda, saying, Go to the family of Archabin and thou shalt bring them to the house of the Lord, into one of the courts, and give them wine to drink. Accordingly I brought Jechonias son of Jeremin son of Chabasin with his brethren and his sons, even all the family of Archabin, and took them into the house of the Lord, to the chamber of the sons of Jonan son of Ananias son of Godolias, a man of God, which is near the house of the chiefs who are above the house of Maasias son of Selom, the keeper of the court. And having set before them a pot of wine and drinking cups, I said, drink wine. Thereupon they said, We must not drink wine. For Jonadab son of Rechab our father gave us a charge, saying, You shall not drink wine; neither you nor your sons forever; neither shall you build houses, nor sow seed, nor have a vineyard; for you shall dwell in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn. Accordingly we have hearkened to the voice of Jonadab our father so as not to drink wine all our days, neither we nor our wives, nor our sons nor our daughters; and we have not built houses here to live in, nor have we vineyard, or field or seed; but have dwelt in tents and have hearkened and done according to all that our father Jonadab commanded us. So when Nabuchodonosar came up against the land, we determined upon coming and came to Jerusalem out of the way of the army of the Chaldeans and out of the way of the army of the Assyrians, and here we have made our abode.
12 Upon this a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Go and say to the men of Juda and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you never receive instruction to hearken to my words? The children of Jonadab son of Rechab have stedfastly observed the command which he gave them not to drink wine: and they have not drunk any. But I have spoken to you, rising early; and you have not hearkened.

15 Though I have sent to you my servants the prophets; saying, Turn ye, every one from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after strange gods to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I gave to you and your fathers; yet you have not inclined your ears nor hearkened. The sons of Jonadab son of Rechab have stedfastly observed the command of their father; but this people have not hearkened to me.

17 Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I will bring upon Juda and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evils which I have denounced against them. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Seeing the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab have obeyed the command of their father and have done as he ordered them; there shall never be wanting a man of the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab to stand before me all the days of this land.

XXIII. 40 XVI. BECAUSE of this prophesy (ch. 16, v. 14, 15) "Behold the days are coming, saith the Lord, When they shall no more say, 'As the Lord liveth who brought up the house of Israel, out of the land of Egypt,' but, 'As the Lord liveth who gathered all the seed of Israel from the land of the north and from all the countries whither he had driven them and re-established them in their own land'" the Lord shewed me two baskets of figs set before the temple of the Lord, after Nabuchodonosar the king of Babylon had carried away Jehonias son of Joakim king of Juda and the chiefs and the artisans and the prisoners of war and the rich men from Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon. The one was a basket of very fine figs, such as are first ripe; and the other was a basket of very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten. And the Lord said to me, What seest thou, Jeremias? And I said, Figs. The good figs, very good: and the bad figs, very bad—so bad, that they cannot be eaten. Then a word of the Lord
came to me saying, Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, Like these good figs so will I acknowledge for good those banished Jews whom I have sent from this place to the land of the Chaldeans. And I will fix mine eyes upon them for good and re-establish them in this land for good. And I will build them up and not pull them down: and I will plant them and not root them up: and I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they will turn to me with their whole heart.

But like those bad figs which for their badness cannot be eaten, thus saith the Lord, So will I deliver up Zedekias king of Juda and his nobles and the remnant of Jerusalem—them who are left in this land and them who dwell in Egypt. Them indeed I will devote to dispersion in all the kingdoms of the earth; and they shall be for a reproach and for a by-word and for a taunt and a curse in every place whither I shall drive them. And I will send against them famine and pestilence and the sword, until they are utterly consumed from this land which I gave them.

XXX. XVII. THE word which came from the Lord to Jeremias, to wit.

Thus spake the Lord the God of Israel, saying, Write all the words which I have delivered to thee in a book: for behold the days are coming saith the Lord when I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel and Juda, said the Lord; and I will bring them to this land, which I gave to their fathers and they shall rule over it.

Now these are the words which the Lord spake concerning Israel and Juda. Thus said the Lord, You shall hear the sound of terror. It is terror and not peace. Inquire and see! Hath a male ever brought forth? Now with respect to the terror, in which they will hold their loins, it is indeed for a deliverance.

(p) Why then have I seen every man with his hands on his loins? Their faces are turned to paleness.

(J) It is because that great day is come which is unparalleled. It is indeed a distressful time to Jacob, but by this he shall be saved. In that day, saith the Lord, I will break the
yoke from their neck, and burst their bonds asunder; and they shall no more work for strangers. But they must work for the Lord their God and I will raise up for them David their king.

Thus said the Lord, I raised up affliction; thy wound was grievous; there is none to plead thy cause; the attempts to cure thee increased thy pain; there is no relief for thee; all thy friends forgot thee; they would make no inquiry for thee; because I inflicted on thee the wound of an enemy, a severe chastisement for all thine iniquity; thy sins had multiplied: therefore all that devour thee shall be devoured, and all thine enemies shall eat their own flesh. For the multitude of thine iniquities (thy sins indeed were multiplied) they have done all these things to thee; but they who plunder thee shall be for plunder; and all who have preyed upon thee, I will give for a prey. Because I will bring up the cure for thee I will cure thee, saith the Lord, of thy painful wound; because thou wast called the Outcast, the hunt is up after thee; because there is none who seeketh this outcast, thus saith the Lord, Behold I myself will bring back the outcast of Jacob, and his captivity I will compassionate. And the city shall be rebuilt on its height; and the people shall sit for the administration of justice. And from them shall come forth singers—the sound of the sportive; and I will multiply them and they shall not be diminished. And their sons shall come in as in former times; and their judicatories shall be established in my presence. And I will punish them who afflict them. His own mighties shall preside over them; and from him his own chief shall come forth; and he will gather them that they may return to me—that he who hath given his heart, whoever he is, may return to me, saith the Lord. Because the anger of the Lord hath gone forth—hath gone forth a furious anger, it will come whirling on the wicked—the fierce anger of the Lord will not turn back, till he hath done—till he hath executed the purpose of his heart. In the latter days you will know these things.

At that time, said the Lord, I will be the God of the family of Israel and they shall be my people.

Thus said the Lord, I found him warm in the wilderness among them who had perished by the sword. Go: you shall not destroy Israel. The Lord from afar hath appeared for him:
with everlasting love I have loved thee; therefore I have drawn thee into compassion. For I will rebuild thee, and thou shalt be rebuilt. O virgin of Israel, again thou shalt take thy timbrel, and go forth with a congregation of rejoicers. As you have planted vineyards on the mountains of Samaria, plant and sing praises; for there shall be a day of invitation to them who make apologies on the mountains of Ephraim, "Arise and go up to Sion to the Lord your God." For thus said the Lord to Jacob, Rejoice and shout at the head of nations; issue proclamations and sing praises; say, "The Lord hath saved his people, the remnant of Israel." Behold I will bring them from the north and gather them from the extremity of the earth. At the festival of Phasek he shall have a multitude of children who shall return hither. They set out with weeping; but I will bring them up with consolation, causing them to rest at fountains of water in a straight road; and in it they shall not be led astray, for I am become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first born. Hear the words of the Lord, ye nations! and proclaim them to the far distant isles. Say, He, who scattered Israel, will gather them, and guard them as a shepherd doth his flock. Because the Lord hath redeemed Jacob—hath rescued him out of the hand of them who were stronger than he; therefore they shall come and rejoice on mount Sion. They shall indeed come to the good things of the Lord—to a land of corn and wine, and of fruits and herds and flocks; and their soul shall be like a fruitful tree; and they shall no more be hungry. Then shall virgins rejoice in the assembly of youths; the elders also shall be filled with joy; for I will turn their mourning into joy and make them glad. I will enlarge and satisfy the soul of the priests the sons of Levi. And my people shall be regaled with my good things.

Thus said the Lord, There was heard at Rama a sound of lamentation and weeping and wailing—Rachel, weeping for her children, refused to be comforted, because they are no more.

Thus saith the Lord, Let thy voice refrain from lamentation and thine eyes from tears. For there is a reward for thy works and they shall return from the enemies' land. It is firmly established for thy children. I have heard the voice of Ephraim moaning, "Thou hast chastised me and I have been
chastised. I like a bullock was uninstructed, bring me back that I may return; for thou art the Lord my God. For after my captivity I reformed and after I gained knowledge I groaned for my days of shame and shewed thee that I was ashamed of my youth." Ephraim is a beloved son—my darling child; since my words are in him I will surely remember him. For this cause I have been anxious for him, I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord. Establish thyself, O Sion; take revenge—rouse up thy courage. By the way thou wentest return, O virgin of Israel—return to thy cities, O mourner. How long shall it be, ere thou wilt return, O despised daughter! Since the Lord hath created safety for a new plantation, with safety men may walk about. For thus saith the Lord, Again they shall use this form of words in the land of Juda and in his cities when I have brought back his captivity, "Blessed be the Lord on his righteous, his holy mountain." It shall be used by them who dwell in the cities of Juda and in all his land, and shall be repeated by the husbandman and among the flocks. For I have satisfied with drink every thirsty soul; and every soul that was hungry I have filled.

(p) Upon this I awoke and beheld and my sleep was sweet to me.

Therefore behold the days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will sow Israel and Juda with the seed of man and the seed of beast. And it shall be, that as I watched over them to pull down and waste, so I will watch over them to build up and plant, saith the Lord. In those days they shall no more say, "Our fathers ate a sour grape and the childrens' teeth are set on edge." But every one shall die for his own sin. And whoever eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge. Behold the days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Juda. Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt. Because they did not abide by this covenant of mine, therefore I took no care of them. For this, saith the Lord, is my covenant which I will make with the house of Israel; after those days, saith the Lord, I will adapt my laws to their understanding and write them on their hearts, and I
34 will be their God and they shall be my people. And they shall no more teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know me from the greatest to the least of them: for I will be merciful to their iniquities and no more remember their sins.

37 Though the heaven is exalted very high, saith the Lord, and the surface of the earth is depressed far below, yet I will not reject the race of Israel, saith the Lord, for all that they have done, Thus said the Lord who hath given the sun to enlighten the day and the moon and stars to enlighten the night, and hath caused the sea to roar and its billows to resound, the Lord Almighty is his name; If these laws cease to operate in my presence, saith the Lord, then may the race of Israel cease from being a nation before me forever.

38 Behold days are coming, saith the Lord, when a city shall be built to the Lord from the tower of Anameel to the gate of the corner; and the diameter thereof shall extend forward as far as the hills of Gareb: and it shall be enclosed around with choice stones; and all the Asaremoth as far as Nachal Kedron, even to the corner of the horse gate eastward shall be dedicated to the Lord, and it shall no more fail nor shall it be demolished until the age.

XXVII. XVIII. 2 THUS said the Lord, Make thee chains and yokes and put them about thy neck; and thou shalt send them to the king of Idumea and to the king of Moab and to the king of the Ammonites and to the king of Tyre and to the king of Sidon by the hands of their ambassadors, who are coming to meet those sent to Jerusalem to Sedekias king of Juda: and thou shalt charge them to say to their masters,

Thus said the Lord, the God of Israel, Thus shall you say to your masters, As I have made the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm, I can give it to whom it seemeth good in mine eyes. I have given this land to Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon to serve him, and the beasts of the field to work for him. And the nation and the kingdom—all who will not submit their neck to the yoke of the king of Babylon, them I will visit with sword and famine, said the Lord, until they are consumed by his hand. Therefore hearken not to your
false prophets, nor to them who divine or dream for you, nor to your augurers, nor your sorcerers who say, You shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy lies to you to remove you far from your land. But the nation which shall submit its neck to the yoke of the king of Babylon and work for him, that nation I will leave in its own land. It laboureth for him and it shall dwell therein.

So I spoke to Sedekias king of Juda according to all these words, saying, Submit your neck to work for the king of Babylon. For these men prophesy falsehoods to you; for I have not sent them, saith the Lord. They indeed prophesy in my name for falsehood to destroy you; therefore you shall be destroyed, both you and your prophets who prophesy to you for unjust falsehood. To you and to all this people and to the priests I have spoken, saying, Thus said the Lord, Hearken not to the words of those prophets who prophesy to you saying, "Behold the vessels of the house of the Lord shall be brought back from Babylon." For they prophesy falsities to you. I have not sent them. If they are prophets; if the word of the Lord is in them, let them meet me. For thus saith the Lord, Even the residue of the vessels which the king of Babylon did not take when he carried away Jechonias from Jerusalem, shall go to Babylon, saith the Lord.

Again it came to pass in the fourth year of Sedekias king of Juda, in the fifth month, that Ananias son of Azor, the false prophet from Gabaon spoke to me in the house of the Lord, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying, Thus said the Lord, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon—yet two years of days and I will bring back to this place the vessels of the house of the Lord, and Jechonias and the captives of Juda; for I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. Thereupon Jeremias said to Ananias in the presence of all the people and in the presence of the priests who were standing in the house of the Lord, "May the Lord indeed do so, said Jeremias; may he establish the word which thou hast spoken, by bringing back the vessels of the house of the Lord and all the captives from Babylon to this place. Nevertheless hear ye the word of the Lord, which I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people. There have been
prophets of old before me, and before you, who have prophesied of war against many a land and against great kingdoms. As for the prophet who hath prophesied peace; when his word cometh to pass let the people acknowledge him as a prophet whom the Lord hath indeed sent to them." Then in the presence of all the people, Ananias took the yokes from the neck of Jeremias and broke them. And Ananias spoke before all the people, saying, "Thus said the Lord, So will I break the yoke of the king of Babylon from the necks of all the nations." So Jeremias went his way.

And there came a word of the Lord to Jeremias, after Ananias had broken the yokes from his neck, saying, "Go and speak to Ananias and say, Thus said the Lord, Thou hast broken wooden yokes; but instead of them I will make yokes of iron. For thus said the Lord, I have put an iron yoke on the neck of all the nations, that they may work for the king of Babylon." Then Jeremias said to Ananias, the Lord hath not sent thee; and thou hast made this people trust in a lie. For this cause thus saith the Lord, "Behold I send thee from the face of the earth. This very year thou shalt die." So he died in the seventh month.

Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremias sent from Jerusalem to the elders of the captivity and to the priests and to the false prophets.—After the departure of king Jechonias and of the queen and the chamberlains and of every nobleman and prisoner of war and artificer from Jerusalem [I sent] to Babylon by the hand of Eleasan son of Saphan and of Gamarias son of Chelkias whom Sedekias king of Juda sent to the king of Babylon at Babylon, a letter for the captives addressed to all the people saying, Thus said the Lord the God of Israel to the captivity whom I have exiled from Jerusalem, "Build houses and dwell therein; and plant orchards and eat the fruits thereof; and take wives and beget sons and daughters; take wives also for your sons and give your daughters in marriage; and multiply and be not diminished; and study the peace of the country to which I have exiled you; and pray to the Lord for the people; for in their peace you will have peace. For thus said the Lord, Let not the false prophets among you deceive you; nor let your diviners deceive you; nor
10 hearken to your dreams which you dream. For they prophesy falsehood to you in my name, and I have not sent them. For thus said the Lord, When seventy years shall be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and establish my words for you by bringing back your people to this place. When I plan a purpose of peace and not evils against you, to grant you this, then pray to me and I will hearken to you: then seek me diligently and you shall find me. Because you will seek me with your whole heart, therefore I will manifest myself to you."

15 Because you said, The Lord hath raised up prophets for us in Babylon, thus said the Lord against Achiab and against Sedekias, behold I deliver them into the hands of the king of Babylon and he will smite them before your eyes. And among all the captives of Juda at Babylon; they shall from them use an execration saying, "The Lord deal with thee as he did with Sedekias, and as he did with Achiab whom the king of Babylon roasted with fire," because they have committed iniquity in Israel and have committed adultery with the wives of their fellow citizens, and have delivered as prophets a word in my name, which I did not give them in charge. I myself am witness saith the Lord. And to Samaias the Ailamite thou shalt say, I did not send thee: yet in my name he said to Sophonias son of Maasias, the priest, "The Lord hath made thee priest in the room of Jodae the priest, to be a ruler in the house of the Lord, over every man who prophesieth, and over every man who divineth, that thou mayst commit him to prison, and confine him in a dungeon." Now why have you reviled Jeremias of Anathoth who prophesied to you? Was it not for this purpose that information was given that within this month he had sent to you to Babylon, saying, Your return is far off; build houses and dwell therein; plant orchards and eat the fruits thereof. When Sophonias read this letter in the hearing of Jeremias, a word of the Lord came to Jeremias saying, Send to the captives, and say, Thus said the Lord, against Samaias the Ailamite, Because Samaias hath prophesied to you, and I did not send him, and he hath made you trust in falsehoods, therefore thus said the Lord, Behold I will punish Samaias and his family, and there shall not be a man of them
among you to see the good things which I will do for you. They shall not see them.

XXI. XIX. THE word which came from the Lord to Jeremias when king Sedekias sent to him Paschor son of Melchias, and Sophonias son of Basaias the priest saying, Inquire of the Lord concerning us for the king of Babylon is come against us. Will the Lord do according to all his wonderous works that he may depart from us. Thereupon Jeremias said to them, Thus shall you say to Sedekias king of Juda, Thus saith the Lord, Behold I turn back the weapons of war with which you fight against the Chaldeans who have besieged you without the wall. And I will bring them into this city. I myself indeed will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a strong arm, with wrath and with great indignation. And I will smite all the inhabitants of this city, both men and beasts with a great pestilence, and they shall die. And after that, saith the Lord, I will deliver Sedekias king of Juda and his servants and the people left in this city from the pestilence and from the famine and from the sword, into the hands of their enemies who seek their lives, and they shall smite them with the edge of the sword. I will not spare them, nor will I have compassion on them. And to this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, Behold I have set before you the way of life and the way of death. He who abideth in this city, shall die by the sword and famine, but he who goeth out to the Chaldeans who have besieged you, he shall live. His life shall be given him for a spoil and he shall live. For I have set my face against this city for evils and not for good. It shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire. With respect to the house of the king of Juda, hear a word of the Lord, O house of David. Thus saith the Lord, Administer judgment in the morning and relieve and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of him who wrongeth him, that my wrath may not be kindled like a fire and blaze so that none can quench it.

XXXIV. XX. THE word which came to Jeremias from the Lord, when Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon, with all his
army and every country under his dominion were warring against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Juda, saying,
2 Thus said the Lord, Go to Sedekias king of Juda and say to him, Thus said the Lord, This city shall assuredly be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon; and he shall take it, and burn it with fire. And thou shalt not escape out of his hand. Thou shalt indeed be taken and delivered into his hands; and thine eyes shall see his eyes; and to Babylon thou shalt go.
3 Nevertheless hear the word of the Lord, O Sedekias king of Juda, Thus said the Lord, Thou shalt die in peace; and as they bewailed thy fathers who reigned before thee so will they bewail thee with "Alas Lord" and utter a lamentation for thee at thy burial; for I have spoken the word said the Lord.
6 So Jeremias delivered to king Sedekias all these words
7 at Jerusalem when the army of the king of Babylon was warring against Jerusalem and against the cities of Juda namely against Lachis and against Azeka; for they were the only fortified cities which were left of the cities of Juda.

8 XXI. The word which came to Jeremias from the Lord.
After king Sedekias had made a covenant with the people
9 to proclaim a release, that every man should set free his man servant and his maid servant of Hebrew extraction so that no
10 person of Juda should continue in slavery; when all the nobles and all the people who had entered into covenant, to set free
11 every one his man servant, and his maid servant, altered
12 their minds and compelled them to become their servants;
13 thereupon a word of the Lord came to Jeremias saying, Thus said the Lord, I made a covenant with your fathers, at the time I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the
14 house of bondage, saying, When six years are accomplished thou shalt set at liberty thy brother, a Hebrew, who shall be sold to thee. When he hath worked for thee six years, thou shalt let him go free. But they have not hearkened to me,
15 nor inclined their ear. And now when they turned to do what is right in my sight, by proclaiming a general release, every one to his neighbour; and had made a covenant in my pre-
16 sence in the house which is called by my name; you have turned back and profaned my name, by causing every one his man servant, and every one his maid servant whom you had sent away free at their own disposal, to return and become your servants: therefore thus said the Lord, You have not hearkened to me to proclaim a general release, every one to his neighbour; behold, I proclaim a dismissal of you to the sword, and to pestilence and to famine; and I will deliver you up to dispersion in all the kingdoms of the earth. I will indeed give up the men who have transgressed my covenant—them, who have not stood to this covenant of mine which they entered into in my presence—as the labouring bullock which they sacrificed I will deliver up the chiefs of Juda and the rulers, and the priests, and the people themselves to their enemies: and their carcases shall be meat for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth: and I will deliver Sedekias king of Judea, and their chiefs, into the hands of their enemies. And as for the army of the king of Babylon, even to them who are retreating, behold I am about to issue orders, saith the Lord, and I will cause them to return to this city. And they shall fight against it, and take it and burn it with fire. And I will make the cities of Juda a desolation, without inhabitants.

XXXVII. XXII. When Sedekias son of Josias, whom Nabuchodonosar had made king over Juda, reigned in the room of Joakim, and neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land hearkened to the words which the Lord spoke by the ministry of Jeremias and king Sedekias: sent Joachel son of Sele-mias and Sophonias son of Maasias the priest to Jeremias saying, Pray now to the Lord for us. (Now Jeremias went out and came in through the midst of the city and they had not committed him to prison, and the army of Pharao had come out of Egypt, and the Chaldeans had heard the news of them when they came up against Jerusalem.) Then a word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying, Thus said the Lord, Thus shalt thou say to the king of Juda who hath sent to thee to inquire of me, Behold the army of Pharao which is coming to your assistance shall turn back to the land of Egypt, and the Chalde-
ans shall return and fight against this city and take it and burn it with fire. For thus said the Lord, Flatter not yourselves, saying, "The Chaldeans are retreating; they will depart from us." For they shall not depart. Nay, though you should smite all the army of the Chaldeans who are warring against you and only some wounded men should be left, every one in his place; these shall rise up and burn this city with fire.

Now when the army of the Chaldeans left Jerusalem, on account of the army of Pharao, Jeremias was going out of Jerusalem among the people with a design to go to the land of Benjamin, to make thence some purchase; but when he was at the gate of Benjamin, a man there at whose house he stopped namely Sarouia son of Selemias, son of Ananias, took hold of Jeremias, saying, Thou art fleeing to the Chaldeans. To which he replied, It is false. I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans. But Sarouia hearkened not to him, but took hold of Jeremias and brought him to the chiefs. And the chiefs were enraged at Jeremias and smote him and committed him to the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that a prison. And when Jeremias had gone into the lowest apartment, even into the Chereth, and had been there many days, Sedekias sent for him. And the king asked him privately to tell him whether there was a message from the Lord. And Jeremias said, There is. Thou shalt be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon. Then Jeremias said to the king, Wherein have I offended thee and thy servants and this people, that thou hast committed me to prison? Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you saying, "The king of Babylon shall not come against this land?" Now therefore, my Lord the king, let me find favour in thy sight. Why art thou sending me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe? Must I not die there? Thereupon the king gave orders and they committed him to the guard house and gave him a loaf of bread a day from the bake house until all the bread in the city was spent. So Jeremias remained in the court of the prison.

XXXII. XXIII. THE word which came from the Lord to Jeremias in the tenth year of king Sedekias; this was the eighteenth year of the reign of Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon. When
the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremias was confined in the court of the prison which is in the king's house, to which king Sedekias had confined him, saying, "Why dost thou prophesy and say, thus said the Lord, Behold I deliver this city into the hands of the king of Babylon and he shall take it; and Sedekias shall not escape out of the hands of the Chaldeans, for he shall assuredly be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon who shall speak to him mouth to mouth and his eyes shall see his eyes: and Sedekias shall go to Babylon." Now when he was there, the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying, Behold Anameel son of Salom thy father's brother is coming to thee and will say, Buy thee my field which is at Anathoth, for the right of purchase is in thee.

Accordingly Anameel son of Salom my father's brother came to me in the court of the prison and said, Buy thee my field which is in the land of Benjamin, that at Anathoth, for the right of purchase is in thee as thou art the eldest. Upon this I knew that it was a word of the Lord, so I bought the field of Anameel, my father's brother's son and paid him seventeen shekels of silver. And when I had signed the writing and sealed it and had it witnessed and had paid the money by weight, I took the deed of possession which was sealed and gave it to Baruch, son of Nerias son of Maasias in the presence of Anameel my father's brother's son, and in the presence of the bystanders who had signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of the Jews who were in the court of the prison; and in their presence I gave a charge to Baruch, saying, Thus said the Lord Almighty, Take this deed of possession, even this deed which hath been read, and put it in an earthen vessel that it may remain there many days. For thus said the Lord, Fields and houses and vineyards shall again be possessed in this land. And after I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Nerias, I prayed to the Lord, saying,

O self-existent Lord, Thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and by thy high and exalted arm. From thee nothing can be hid. Thou shewest mercy to thousands and retributest the sins of fathers into the bosoms of their children after them. Thou art the God, the Great, the Mighty
One, the Lord of great counsel, and mighty in works, the Mighty Omnipotent God, and the Lord of great renown. Thine eyes are on the ways of the children of men to give to every one according to his way. Thou hast done signs and wonders in the land of Egypt which continue even to this day; and in Israel and among the inhabitants of the earth; and hast made thyself a name as at this day. Thou didst bring thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders and with a strong hand and an outstretched arm and with stupendous visions, and gavest them this land which with an oath thou hadst promised to their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey. But when they entered in and had taken possession of it, they hearkened not to thy voice nor walked in thy statutes. They did not do all that thou commandedst them, so they have brought upon themselves all these evils. Behold a multitude is come up against this city to take it; and this city is about to be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it, by reason of the sword and famine. As thou hast spoken, so it hath come to pass. Now thou sayest to me, Buy thee a field for money. Accordingly I have signed the deed of purchase and sealed it and had it witnessed; though the city is about to be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans.

Then a word of the Lord came to me saying, I the Lord am the God of all flesh. From me nothing can be hid. Therefore thus said the Lord the God of Israel, This city will assuredly be given up into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will take it. And the Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will come and burn this city with fire; and they will burn those houses on the tops of which they have offered incense to Baal and poured out libations to strange gods, to provoke me. Because the children of Israel and the children of Juda have done nothing but evil before mine eyes from their youth—because this very city hath been an object of my wrath and of my resentment from the day it was built to this day; let him remove it from my presence on account of all the iniquities of the children of Israel and Juda, which they and their kings and their chiefs and their priests and their prophets, the men of Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have done to provoke me. For they have turned to me their back and not their face.
Though I taught them betimes, they would no more receive instruction, but have set up their abominations in the house which is called by my name, and polluted it with their impurities; and have built up the altars to Baal which were in the valley of the son of Ennom to offer up their sons and their daughters to king Moloch—a thing which I never commanded them, nor did it ever come into my mind that they should commit such an abomination to cause Juda to transgress heinously.

But now thus said the Lord the God of Israel respecting this city, which as thou sayest shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon by sword and by famine and by pestilence; behold I will gather them from every land through which I have in my wrath and in my great indignation dispersed them: and I will bring them back to this place and cause them to live securely. And they shall be my people and I will be their God. And I will give them another way and another heart that I may be always feared and may be for good to them and their children after them. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, which I will not turn away from them; and I will put my fear in their heart, that they may not apostatise from me; and I will watch over them to do them good, and plant them in this land with faithfulness even with my whole heart and soul. For thus said the Lord, as I have brought upon this people all these great evils, so I will bring upon them all these good things, which I have spoken concerning them. And fields shall again be purchased in this land which as thou sayest shall be untrodden by men and beasts when they are delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans. And they shall purchase fields for money. And thou shalt subscribe deeds and seal them and cause them to be witnessed in the land of Benjamin and around Jerusalem and in the cities of Juda and in the cities of the mountain and in the cities of Sephela and in the cities of Nageb; for I will bring back their captivities.

XXXIII. XXIV. AGAIN a word of the Lord came to Jeremias a second time while he was still a prisoner in the court of the prison, saying, Thus saith the Lord, the maker of the earth, who formed it that he might regulate it. His name is
the Lord; Cry to me and I will answer thee and shew thee great and marvellous things which thou hast not known. For thus said the Lord concerning the houses of this city; and concerning the houses of the king of Juda which have been pulled down to make mounts and ramparts to fight against the Chaldeans and to fill the city with the carcasses of men whom I have slain in mine indignation and in my wrath; and from whom I have turned away my face for all their wicked deeds; behold I am raising up for it a cure for wounds and a restorative, which I will shew them, and I will heal it and give it peace and fidelity. And I will bring back the captivity of Juda and the captivity of Israel; and I will build them up as in former times. And I will cleanse them from all their iniquities which they have committed against me, and no more remember the sins which they sinned against me, when they apostatised from me. And it shall be for a joy and praise and for a subject of exultation to all the people of the earth who shall hear all the good things which I will do. And they will be struck with awe and remorse for all the good and for all the peace which I will procure for them.

Thus said the Lord, In the place which you say is a desert without men and beasts—in the cities of Juda and in the streets of Jerusalem which have been desolate so as to have neither man nor beast, there shall be heard again the sound of joy and the sound of mirth; the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; the voice of people, saying, "Praise the Lord Almighty; for the Lord is gracious; for his mercy endureth forever." And they shall bring gifts to the house of the Lord. For I will bring back all the captivity of this land, as in former times, saith the Lord.

Thus saith the Lord of hosts, There shall be again in this very place which shall be desolate, without man or beast, in all the cities belonging to it lodging places for shepherds folding flocks. In the cities of the hilly country and in the cities of Sephela, and in the cities of Nageb and in the land of Benjamin and in those around Jerusalem and in the cities of Juda, flocks shall again pass under the hand of him that counteth them, said the Lord.
XXXVIII. XXV. WHEN Saphanias son of Nathan and Godolias son of Paschor and Joachal son of Semelias, heard the words which Jeremias spoke concerning the people saying,
2 "Thus said the Lord, He who abideth in this city shall die by the sword and the famine; but he who goeth out to the Chaldeans shall live. He shall have his life for a spoil. He shall live. For thus said the Lord, This city shall certainly be delivered into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon and he shall take it," they said to the king, Let this man, we pray thee, be put out of the way; for he weakeneth the hands of the warriors who are left in the city and the hands of all the people by making such speeches to them. For this man prophesieth not peace to the people, but only evils. And the king said, Behold he is in your hands. For the king could not withstand them. So they threw him into the dungeon of Melchias the king's son which was in the court of the prison. And when they had lowered him down into the dungeon, there was no water in the dungeon, but there was mire; and he was in the mire. But when Abdemelech, the Ethiopian, who was in the king's family, heard that they had put Jeremias in the dungeon, as the king was at the gate of Benjammin, he went out to him and spoke to the king, and said, Thou hast done wrong in ordering this man to be put to death out of the way of the famine, for there is no bread in the city. Thereupon the king gave orders to Abdemelech, saying, Take hence with thee thirty men and draw him up out of the dungeon, that he may not die. So Abdemelech took the men and went to the king's house, into the cellar, and took thence old rags and old ropes and threw them down to Jeremias into the dungeon, and said, Put those under the ropes. And when Jeremias had done so, they drew him up with the ropes out of the dungeon. And Jeremias abode in the court of the prison.
14 And the king sent and ordered him to come to him to the house Aseleisel which is in the house of the Lord. And the king said to him, I will ask thee a word and thou must not conceal any thing from me. And Jeremias said to the king, If I tell thee, wilt thou not put me to death? And if I give thee counsel, perhaps thou wilt not hearken to me. Then the king swore to him, saying, As the Lord liveth who made us this soul, I will not put thee to
17 death, nor will I deliver thee into the hands of those men. And Jeremias said, Thus said the Lord, If thou wilt go out to the generals of the king of Babylon, thy soul shall live and this city will not be burned with fire. Both thou and thy family shall live. But if thou wilt not go out, this city will be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans and they will burn it with fire; and thou shalt not escape. And the king said to Jeremias, I am afraid of the Jews who have fled to the Chaldeans, lest upon being delivered into their hand they make me a mocking stock. And Jeremias replied, Thou wilt not be delivered up to them, Hear the word of the Lord which I speak to thee and it will be better for thee and thy soul shall live. But if thou wilt not go out, this is the word which the Lord hath revealed to me,

22 "And behold all the women who were left in the house of the king of Juda were brought out to the chiefs of the king of Babylon. And they said, Thy men of peace deceived thee, and will prevail over thee. And with a fall they will weaken thy foot. They are gone from thee. And thy wives and thy children shall be brought out to the Chaldeans. And thou shalt not escape. For by the hand of the king of Babylon thou shalt be taken and this city shall be burned."

24 Then the king said to him, Let no man know any of these words, and thou shalt not be put to death. And if the chiefs hear that I have spoken to thee and come to thee and say, Tell us, What did the king say to thee? Hide it not from us and we will not put thee to death. What did the king say to thee? Then thou shalt say to them, I presented my supplication before the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there. So when all the chiefs came to Jeremias and questioned him, he answered them according to all the words which the king commanded and they were silent; for the word of the Lord was not heard. So Jeremias remained in the court of the prison until Jerusalem was taken.

XXXIX. Now it came to pass that in the ninth year and ninth month of Sedekias king of Juda, Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon with all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it. And in the eleventh year of Sedekias in the fourth month on the ninth day of the month, a breach was made into the city;
and all the generals of the king of Babylon entered and sat in the middle gate, namely, Marganasar, and Samagoth and Nabusachar and Nabusaris, Nagargas, Naserrabamath, and the rest of the generals of the king of Babylon; and they sent and took Jeremias out of the court of the prison and committed him to Godolias son of Achikam son of Saphan. And when they brought him out he sat down among the people.

Now there had come to Jeremias in the court of the prison a word of the Lord, saying, Go and say to Abdemelech the Ethiopian, Thus said the Lord the God of Israel, Behold I will bring my words on this city for evils and not for good. But I will save thee on that day and not deliver thee into the hands of those men of whom thou art afraid. For I will save thee and thou shalt not fall by the sword. And thou shalt have thy life for a spoil, because thou hast trusted in me, said the Lord.

XL. XXVI. The word which came from the Lord to Jeremias after Nabusardan the chief cook, he who was of Rama, had dismissed him.

WHEN the chief cook found him in chains in the midst of the captives of Juda who were to be carried to Babylon, he took him and said to him, The Lord thy God hath denounced all these evils against this place, and the Lord hath done them, because you sinned against him and did not hearken to his voice. Behold I have loosed thee from the chains which were on thy hands. If it seemeth good to thee to go with me to Babylon, I will have an eye over thee. But if not, Go thy way. Return to Godolias son of Achikam son of Saphan whom the king of Babylon hath set over the land of Juda and dwell with him among the people in the land of Juda. Go whithersoever it seemeth best in thine eyes to go. So the chief cook gave him gifts and dismissed him; and he went to Godolias to Massepha and dwelt among his people who were left in the land. Now when all the generals of the army in the country, both they and their men heard that the king of Babylon had set Godolias over the land, and had committed to him the men and their wives whom he had not removed to Babylon, there came to Godolias, at Massepha, Ismael son of Nathanias and Joanan son of Karae and Saraiaas son of Thanaemeth and the sons of Jophe the Ne-
9 tophathite and Ezonias son of Mochathi, they and their men; and Godolias swore to them and their men, saying, Be not afraid of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be better for you. As for me, behold I reside before you, at Massepha to meet the Chaldeans who may come against you. But as for you, collect wine and summer fruits and oil and lay them up in your vessels and dwell in the cities which you have taken possession of. All the Jews also who were in Moab and among the Ammonites and those in Idumea and in all that country, when they heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant for Juda and had set Godolias son of Achikam over them, came to Godolias into the land of Juda to Massepha, and collected wine and summer fruits in great abundance, and oil. And Joanan son of Karae and all the generals of the army who were in the country came to Godolias to Massepha and said to him, Dost thou know that Beleissa king of the Ammonites hath sent Ismael to thee, to take thy life. But Godolias did not believe them. And when Joanan said privately to Godolias at Massepha, "Let me, I pray thee, go and smite Ismael and let none know it; lest he kill thee; and all Juda who are gathered to thee, be dispersed and the remnant of Juda perish." Godolias said to Joanan, Thou must not do this: for what thou sayest of Ismael is false.

XLI. Now it came to pass that in the seventh month Ismael son of Nathanias son of Eleasa of the royal family and ten chief men with him came to Godolias at Massepha and they there ate bread together. And Ismael arose and the ten chiefs who were with him, and smote Godolias whom the king of Babylon had set over the land, and all the Jews who were with him at Massepha and all the Chaldeans who were found there. And it happened that on the second day after he had slain Godolias and it was not generally known, there came eighty men from Sychem and from Salem and from Samaria, with their beards shaven and their clothes rent and in deep mourning, with manna and frankincense in their hands, to make an offering for the house of the Lord. And Ismael went out to meet them as they were proceeding on in their journey weeping, and said to them, Come to Godolias. And when they were come into the midst of the
8 city he slew them at the pit. But there were ten men among them who said to Ismael, Do not kill us; for we have treasures in a field, wheat and barley, honey and oil. So he forbore and did not kill them among their brethren. Now the pit, into which Ismael threw all that he had slain, was that great pit which king Asa had made for fear of Baasa king of Israel. This Ismael filled with the slain. And Ismael carried away all the people who were left at Massepha and the king's daughters whom the chief cook had committed to the care of Godolias son of Achikam; and fled towards the borders of the Ammonites. But when Joanan son of Karae and all the generals of the army who were with him heard all the evils which Ismael had done, they drew out their whole army and marched with speed to fight him and came up with him at the great waters at Gabaon. And when all the people who were with Ismael saw Joanan and the generals of the army who were with him, they turned back to Joanan; but Ismael escaped with eight men and fled to the children of Ammon. Then Joanan and all the generals of the army who were with him took all the remnant of the people whom they had rescued from Ismael—the men fit for war and the women and children and the eunuchs whom they brought back from Gabaon and marching with speed they encamped at Gaberochama which is near Bethlehem with an intent to go to Egypt for fear of the Chaldeans.

For they were afraid of them because Ismael had slain Godolias whom the king of Babylon had set over the land. And all the generals of the army with Joanan and Azarias son of Maasias and all the people small and great came to Jeremias the prophet and said to him, Have compassion on us, we beseech thee and pray to the Lord thy God for this remnant, for we are left only few of many as thine eyes see. Now let the Lord thy God point out to us the way which we should go and what we are to do. Whereupon Jeremias said to them, I have heard. Behold, I will pray for you to the Lord our God according to your words and whatever answer the Lord our God shall give that I will declare to you. I will not hide any thing from you. And they said to Jeremias, The Lord be a true and faithful witness between us, that we will act conformably to the word, whatever it be, which the Lord shall send
6 to us. Whether it be agreeable or disagreeable we will hearken to the voice of the Lord our God in respect to that for which we send thee to him, that it may be the better for us. We will obey the voice of the Lord our God.

7 Soafter ten days a word of the Lord came to Jeremias, where-

8 upon he sent for Joanan and the generals of the army, and all

9 the people small and great, and said to them, Thus said the Lord, "If you will abide in this land I will build you up, and

10 not pull you down; and I will plant you, and not root you up;

11 for I am appeased by the evils which I have done to you. Be not afraid of the king of Babylon of whom you are in dread. Be not afraid of him, saith the Lord, for I am with you to de-

12 liver you, and to save you out of his hands. And I will shew you mercy, and have compassion on you, and bring you back

13 to your own land. But if in direct disobedience to the voice

14 of the Lord you say, "We will not abide in this land; for we will go to the land of Egypt, that we may not see war nor hear the trumpet's sound, nor pine for want of bread; and we

15 will dwell there." Then hear the word of the Lord, Thus said the Lord, If you set your face for Egypt, and go there to make

16 your abode; the sword of which you are afraid shall find you in the land of Egypt; and the famine which you wish to avoid shall follow and overtake you in Egypt, and there you shall die. For all the men even all the strangers who have set their faces towards the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall perish by the sword and by famine, and not one of them shall escape

18 from those evils which I bring upon them. For thus said the Lord, As my wrath was poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured out upon you, if you go to Egypt; and you shall be wasted and made slaves, and be for an execration and reproach; and shall never see this land again.

19 These are the things which the Lord hath spoken respecting you, the remnant of Juda; that you may not go to Egypt.

20 For now you must be sensible that you did evil in your hearts when you sent me saying, Pray for us to the Lord, and we will act conformably to all that the Lord shall say to thee.

21 For you have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord, which

22 he hath sent by me to you. Now therefore you shall perish
by the sword and by famine, in that place to which you are determined to go there to make your abode.

XLIII. And when Jeremias had made an end of speaking all these words of the Lord to the people, even all the words which the Lord had sent him to speak to them, Azarias son of Maasias and Joanan son of Karae, and all the men who had spoken to Jeremias, said in reply, It is false. The Lord hath not sent thee to us, saying, You shall not go to Egypt to dwell there. But Baruch son of Nerias setteth thee on against us, that thou mayst deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans to be put to death, or banished to Babylon. So Joanan and all the generals of the army and all the people hearkened not to the voice of the Lord to dwell in the land of Juda. And Joanan and all the generals of the army took all the remnant of Juda, who had returned to dwell in the land, the men fit for war, and the women and the children which were left and the king's daughters, even all the souls which Nabusardan had left with Godolias son of Achikam, including Jeremias the prophet, and Baruch son of Nerias, and went to Egypt. Because they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord, therefore when they came to Taphnas, a word of the Lord came to Jeremias at Taphnas, saying, Take thee large stones and bury them at the entrance of the gate of Pharao's house at Taphnas, in the presence of the men of Juda and thou shalt say, Thus said the Lord, Behold I send and I will bring Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon and he shall place his throne over these stones which thou hast hidden, and pile his arms over them. And when he is come he will smite the land of Egypt, sentencing to death them who are for death; and to banishment such as are for banishment; and to the sword such as are for the sword. And he will kindle a fire in the houses of their gods, and burn the houses and carry away the gods captives: and he will search the land of Egypt, as a shepherd doth his garment, and shall go thence in peace. And he will break in pieces the pillars of Heliopolis, even those of On, and burn their houses with fire.—
XLIV. XXVII. The word which came to Jeremias for all the Jews who dwelt in the land of Egypt—for them settled at Magdolus, and at Taphnas, and in the land of Pathoura, saying.

2 THUS said the Lord the God of Israel, You have seen all the evils which I brought upon Jerusalem, and upon the cities of Juda; and behold they are desolate, without inhabitants because of their wickedness which they committed to provoke me, by going to burn incense to strange gods, which you knew not. Though I sent to you my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Do not commit this abominable thing which I hate; yet they hearkened not to me, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness so as not to burn incense to strange gods. Therefore my wrath and mine indignation was poured out and kindled to a flame in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became a desolation and a waste, as at this day. Now then, thus said the Lord Almighty, Why do ye commit great evils against your souls, to cut off every man and woman of you, with the infant and suckling out of Juda, so that none of you may be left—to provoke me with the works of your hands—by burning incense to strange gods in the land of Egypt, where you are come to dwell—that you may be cut off and become an execration and a reproach, among all the nations of the earth? Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, and the evils of the kings of Juda, and the evils of your chiefs, and the evils of your wives, which they committed in the land of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem? They have not indeed even to this day desisted, nor have they adhered to the ordinances which I set before their fathers; therefore thus said the Lord, Behold I am setting my face to destroy all the remnant in Egypt; and they shall fall by the sword and by famine and die, both small and great: and they shall be for reproach and for destruction and for a curse. For I will visit those settled in Egypt as I visited Jerusalem with sword and with famine, so that none of this remnant of Juda who dwell in Egypt, shall be saved to return to the land of Juda, to which they earnestly hope to return, save those only who have made their escape thither.
15 Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense, and all the women, a great congregation, and all the people who were settled in the land of Egypt at Pathoura answered

16 Jeremias, saying, In regard to this word which thou hast

17 spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee; for we will continue to perform every word which shall proceed from our mouth to burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out libations to her; as we and our fathers and our kings and our chiefs did in the cities of Juda and in the streets of Jerusalem; for we had then plenty of bread and were in happy circumstances and saw no evils: but soon as we left off

18 burning incense to the queen of heaven, we all became fewer

19 in number, and were wasted by sword and famine. Now grant that we have burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out libations to her, have we without our husbands, made cakes for her or poured out to her libations?

20 In reply to this Jeremias said to all the people, to the men in authority, and to the women and all the people who made him this answer;

21 This incense which you offered in the cities of Juda and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, and your kings and your chiefs, and the people of the land, did not the Lord remember? Did it not come into his mind so that the Lord could no longer forbear on the account of your evil doings and on the account of your abominations which you committed?

So your land was made a desolation and a waste, and for

23 a curse as at this day because of the incense, which you offered, and the sins which you committed against the Lord. As you hearkened not to the voice of the Lord, nor walked in his statutes and in his law and in his testimonies; therefore these evils have come upon you.

24 Then Jeremias said to the people, particularly to the women, Hear a word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, Ye women have spoken with your mouths and with your hands confirmed it, saying, We will continue to perform the vows which we made to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and pour out libations to her. You have obstinately adhered to your vows, and have actually performed them.
26 Therefore hear a word of the Lord, all ye of Juda, who are settled in the land of Egypt; behold by my great name I have sworn said the Lord, my name shall no more be mentioned by the mouth of any Jew in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord liveth. Because I have watched over them, to afflict them, and not to do them good, therefore all the Jews who are dwelling in the land of Egypt, shall perish by sword and by famine, until there be an end of them. They indeed who have escaped from the sword being few in number, shall return to the land of Juda; but the remnant of Juda, who have staid in the land of Egypt to settle there, shall know whose word shall stand. Now this shall be a sign to you, that I will visit you for evil: thus said the Lord, Behold I deliver up Onaphre king of Egypt, into the hands of his enemy, and into the hands of him who seeketh his life, as I delivered Sedekias king of Juda into the hands of Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon, his enemy, and who sought his life.

XLV. XXVIII. The word which Jeremias the prophet spoke to Baruch son of Nerias, when he was writing the words in the book, from the mouth of Jeremias, in the fourth year of Joakim son of Josias king of Juda.

2 THUS said the Lord concerning thee Baruch, because thou saidst, "Ah woe is me! for the Lord hath added grief to my sorrow: I laid me down with sighing; no rest did I find."
3 Say to him, Thus said the Lord, Behold! them whom I built up, I am pulling down; them whom I planted, I am rooting up; and wilt thou seek great things for thyself? Seek them not. For behold I am about to bring evils on all flesh, saith the Lord; but I will give thee thy life, for a spoil in every place whither thou shalt go.

XLVI. XXIX. TO EGYPT, respecting the army of Pharao Nechao, king of Egypt, who was by the river Euphrates, at Charmis, whom Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Joakim king of Juda.

3 ARM. with buckler and shields, and 'advance to battle.
4 Harness the horses. Horsemen mount! and stand firm in your helmets. Having put on your breast plates, charge with your
5 lances. Why are they daunted, and falling back? Because their mighty men will be cut down, they fled amain; they rallied not, being hemmed in on all sides, saith the Lord. Let not the swift flee, nor the mighty escape to the north. The forces at the river Euphrates are weak and have fallen. Who is this that will rush forth like the river, and whose stream will billow like a flood? The waters of Egypt will rush forth like a river: for he said, "I will issue forth and overwhelm the earth, and destroy the inhabitants thereof. Mount your horses, prepare your chariots: march forth ye warriors of Ethiopia! and ye Libyans well clad in armour! go up also ye Lydians who bend the bow."

(p) This is indeed a day for the Lord our God: a day of vengeance, to execute vengeance on his enemies. And the sword of the Lord shall devour and be filled; it shall indeed be glutted with their blood; for there is a sacrifice for the Lord in the land of the north at the river Euphrates. Go up, Gallaad, and take balm for the virgin daughter of Egypt. In vain hast thou multiplied thy medicines; there is no cure for thee.

The nations heard thy voice and with thy screams the land was filled: because warrior added to warrior were weak, they both fell together.

XXX. The words which the Lord spoke by the ministry of Jeremias, that the king of Babylon would come and smite the land of Egypt.

DESPATCH messengers to Magdolus; send also to Memphis. Say, to arms! and be ready! for a sword hath laid waste thy grove. Why did Apis flee from thee? Thy chosen bull, why did he not stand? because the Lord made him weak and thy multitude was weak and fell. Therefore every one said to his fellow, Let us arise and return to our people, to our native land, from the face of the Grecian sword. Call the name of Pharao Nechao king of Egypt, "Saon-Esbie-Moed."

As I live, saith the Lord God, like Itaburion among the mountains, and like Charmel which is by the sea he shall come.

Get ready utensils for thy removal, O well housed daughter of Egypt! for Memphis shall be a waste and shall be called, "Alas," because in it there are no inhabitants. Egypt was a
beautiful heifer; a detachment from the north came against her. And the mercenaries, which she had with her, were like fatted bulls which she had fed. For they turned and fled with one consent: they made no stand, because the day of destruction came upon them and the time of their visitation. Their sound is that of a hissing serpent; for they march in dust. With axes they will come against her; like fellers of timber they will cut down her groves, saith the Lord. Because she would not be assimilated.—Because she increaseth more than locusts which are innumerable; the daughter of Egypt is put to shame: she is delivered into the hands of a people from the north. Behold I will punish her son Ammon in the person of Pharao, and in the persons of them who trusted in him. But thou Jacob my servant be not afraid; and thou Israel be not dismayed. For behold I will save thee from afar and thy seed from their captivity. And Jacob shall return and enjoy rest and sleep; and there shall be none to discompose him. Fear not, my servant Jacob, saith the Lord, since I am with thee. This fearless and luxurious one is delivered up, for I will make an end of every nation to which I have driven thee; But of thee I will not make an entire end. But I will correct thee for judgment and not suffer thee to go unpunished.

XLVII. XXXI. Concerning the Philistines,
2 THUS saith the Lord, Behold waters are coming from the north, and they shall become an overwhelming flood, and shall overwhelm the land and the fulness thereof—the cities and them who dwell therein: and the men shall utter the scream of distress, and all the inhabitants of the land, a doleful cry. At the sound of his impetuous onset; at the armour of his infantry; at the rushing of his chariots; the rumbling of his wheels; fathers looked not back on their children, by reason of the feebleness of their hands.
4 In the day which is coming to destroy all the Philistines I will destroy also Tyre and Sidon and all the residue of their help.
XXI. 13 Behold I am against thee who inhabitest the vale of Sor—that plain—them who say, who can terrify us? or who can come into our habitation? And I will kindle a fire in its forests and it shall devour all things around it.
XLVII. 4 (p) Because the Lord will utterly destroy the remnants in the isles, baldness is come upon Gaza: Ascalon is overthrown and the remnant of Enakim.

6 (c) How long wilt thou hew down, O sword of the Lord? How long will it be ere thou wilt rest? Return into thy scabbard, rest and be removed.

7 (p) How can it rest when the Lord hath given it a charge against Ascalon and the cities on the sea coast and to be lifted up against them whom remain?

XLVIII. XXXII. Respecting Moab,

THUS said the Lord, Alas! for Nabo; for it is destroyed.

2 Kariathaim is taken. Amath and Agath are put to shame. There is no more a cure for Moab; a boasting in Esebon. He hath devised evils against her. We have cut her off from being a nation and she shall go to rest. Behind thee the sword shall stalk on.

3 Because there is a sound of screaming from Oronaim—destruction and great tribulation, Moab is trodden down. Despatch news to Zogora that Aloth is filled with lamentation; she will go up weeping by the way of Oronaim. You have heard the scream of distress; flee and save your lives; and you shall be like a wild ass in the desert. Seeing thou hast trusted in thy fortifications; therefore thou shalt be taken; and Chamos shall go into banishment, and his priests and his chiefs with him; and destruction shall come on every city, none shall escape. The vale also shall be destroyed and the plain wasted as the Lord hath said. Set up marks for Moab; for with destruction she shall be destroyed; and all her cities shall be for desolation. Whence can she have an inhabitant? He is cursed who doth the work of the Lord negligently, withholding his sword from blood.

11 Moab enjoyed rest from his youth and trusted in his glory; he hath not been decanted from vessel to vessel; and into banishment he hath never gone. Therefore his taste remaineth in him and his flavour is not lost: Therefore behold the days are coming saith the Lord, when I will send decanters and they shall decant him; and they shall break his vessels and cut to pieces his drinking horns; and Moab shall be put to shame for Chamos, as the house of Israel were for Baithel their confidence. How can ye who have put confidence in them, say,
15 "We are strong, and a man mighty for feats of war." Moab is destroyed with his cities; and his chosen men are gone down to slaughter. The day of Moab is near at hand, and with speed his calamity is approaching. Shake your heads for him, all ye around him; pronounce his name, all of you, say, How the beautiful sceptre is broken! the sceptre of majesty! Come down from glory and sit low in mire. Diabon shall be trampled down because Moab is destroyed. The demolisher of thy strong hold is come up against thee. Stand by the way side and take a view, O inhabitant of Aroer! ask him who is fleeing and making escape, and say, What is the news? Moab is put to shame; for he is utterly discomfited. Raise the mournful cry and scream; proclaim in Arnon, that Moab is destroyed.

21 Judgment is indeed coming on the land of Misor, upon Chalon, and Rephas, and Mophas, and on Daibon, and on Nabo, and on the house of Daithlathaim, and on Kariathaim, and on the house of Gaimol, and on the house of Maon, and on Karioth, and on Bosor, and on all the cities of Moab far and near.

25 The horn of Moab is hacked to pieces, and his prowess is broken. Make him drunk. Because he magnified himself against the Lord, he will therefore clap with his hand at Moab that he may be an object of derision; for was not Israel an object of mirth to thee and found among thy stolen goods, because thou didst fight against him? The inhabitants of Moab have left their cities and made their abode among rocks. They were like pigeons nestling in rocks at the mouth of a cave.

29 (p) I have heard indeed of the pride of Moab: he was very proud—and of his haughtiness; his heart was elated.

30 (J) But as for me I know his works: is not this his desert? Hath he not acted thus? Therefore raise on all sides the mournful cry for Moab; scream for the men of Keiradas-auchmou.

32 (p) With the wailing of Jazer I will wail for thee, O vine of Ascrema. Thy branches extended to the sea; they reached to the cities of Jazer. When thy fruit was ripe; destruction came upon thy grape gatherers. Joy and gladness were snatched from Moab, when the vine was in thy lakes. In the morning there was no treading, and in the evening no shouts of joy. At the scream of Esebon which reached to Aitam, their
cities from Zogar to Oronaim uttered their voice, and spread the news with an alarm.

(J) Because the water of Nebrin also shall be dried up; therefore I will destroy Moab, saith the Lord, when he is going up to the altar and burning incense to his gods.

(p) For this let the heart of Moab groan like drone pipes. Let my heart sound like a drone for the men of Keiradas.

(J) Because all that every man had procured is utterly destroyed; let them every where shave the whole head; and let the whole beard be shaven and all hands gashed; and let there be sackcloth on every loin, and on all the house tops of Moab and in every street: for I have broken him, saith the Lord, like a vessel that is useless. How did he deprecate! How did Moab turn his back! Moab was ashamed and became a subject of laughter and derision to all around. For thus said the Lord, Karioth is taken and the strong holds are surprised; and Moab shall be destroyed from being a multitude. Because he magnified himself against the Lord, a trap, a scare-net and a pit are prepared for thee, O inhabitant of Moab! He who fleeth from the scare-net shall fall into the pit; and he who getteth up out of the pit shall be caught in the trap. For I will bring these things on Moab in the year of their visitation.

XLIX. XXXIII. Respecting the children of Ammon.

THUS said the Lord, Hath Israel no sons? or have they no heir? Why then hath Melchol taken possession of Galaad? Shall his people dwell in their cities? For this cause behold the days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will cause the tumult of battles against Rabbath to be heard; and they shall be for desolation and destruction; and her altars shall be consumed with fire; and Israel shall assume his government.

Raise the mournful cry, O Esebon, for Gai is destroyed. Scream, ye daughters of Rabbath; gird on sackcloth and mourn; for Melchol shall go into banishment and his priests and his chiefs with him. What! are you exulting with joy in the vales of Enakim? O! daughter of wantonness who trustest in thy treasures—who sayest, Who shall come against me?
5 Behold I am bringing terror against thee, said the Lord, from every neighbour around thee: and you shall be scattered every one before it; and there shall be none to collect you.

XXXIV. Respecting Idumea.
7 THUS said the Lord, There is no more any wisdom in Thaiman. Counsel is perished from the prudent. Wisdom is fled from them. Their place hath been led into error.
    (p) O inhabitants of Daidan! retire to a deep settlement for he hath brought on calamities.
    (J) I brought them on him at the time when I visited him.
9 Because grape gatherers are come, who will not leave thee a gleaning. Like thieves by night they will lay to their hands. Because I plundered Esau and discovered their hidden stores; They could not be concealed, they were destroyed.
11 (p) By means of the hand of his brother my neighbour, there is indeed no place for thine orphan to be left that it may live.
    (J) But I will cause it to live. In me the widows have trusted. Because they (said the Lord) who had a law not to drink the cup, drank it; thou therefore shalt not escape unpunished. For by myself I have sworn saith the Lord, thou shalt be a desolation and a reproach and a curse in this country and all its cities shall be perpetual wastes.
14 (p) I have heard a report from the Lord. He hath sent messengers to the nations, [saying] assemble and come against her; arise for battle.
15 (J) I have made thee little among the nations, very contemptible among men. Thine insolency hath entrapped thee; the wantonness of thy heart destroyed the holes of rocks. It took possession of a strong, lofty mountain. Because like an eagle thou hast built thy nest high; thence I will pull thee down: and Idumea shall be a desolation. Every passenger shall express for it the sound of pity. As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorra and the neighbouring cities, said the Lord Almighty, no man shall abide there, nor shall a son of man dwell there. Behold they shall be like the lion which must go up from the swelling of Jordan to Aitham. For I will
speedily drive them from that place. Therefore set ye chosen warriors against it.

20 Because who is like me? Or who can withstand me? And who is the shepherd who can stand before me? Therefore hear the counsel of the Lord which he hath taken against Idumea, and the determination he hath come to against the inhabitants of Thaiman: Let all but the tenderest of the flock be destroyed; let all but a resting place for them be made a desolation.

21 (p) At the sound of their fall the earth trembled, so that
22 the roaring of the sea was not heard. Behold he will take a view like an eagle, and expand his wings against her fortifications; and the heart of the valiant men of Idumea shall be on that day like the heart of a woman in travail.

XXXV. Respecting Damascus.
EMATH and Arphath are overwhelmed in shame. Because they heard bad news they were confounded; they boiled with rage; they cannot take rest. Damascus is enervated. She turned to flee: terror seized her. How can it be otherwise?
26 She forsook my city. Did they regard a single village? Therefore thy young men shall fall in thy streets; and all thy valiant warriors shall fall, saith the Lord. And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus and it shall consume the palaces of Son of Ader.

XXXVI. Respecting Kedar the queen of the court, which Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon smote.
THUS said the Lord; arise and go up against Kedar; and glut the sons of Kedem. Let them seize their tents and their flocks: let them take for themselves their clothing, all their utensils and their camels: and call ye for destruction against all them around. Flee, retire very deep to a settlement, O inhabitants at the court. For against you the king of Babylon hath taken counsel, and hath come to a determination, saying,
31 "Arise and go up against a wealthy nation dwelling at ease who have neither gates nor bars nor bolts—who dwell alone.
32 Let their camels be for a prey and the multitude of their cattle for slaughter." For I will winnow with every wind them who have their foreheads shaven and from all sides I
33 will bring destruction on them, saith the Lord. And the court shall be a lodging place for ostriches and a waste forever. No man shall abide there, nor shall a son of man there make his dwelling.

XXXVII. In the beginning of the reign of king Sedekias came this word concerning Ailam.

THUS saith the Lord, The bow of Ailam is broken, the instrument of his dominion. And I will bring upon Ailam four winds from the four quarters of heaven and I will scatter them with these winds; so that there shall not be a nation to which the outcasts of Ailam shall not come. And I will terrify them before their enemies who seek their lives; and bring against them according to the fury of my wrath, and send against them my sword, until it utterly consume them. And I will set my throne in Ailam and drive thence kings and nobles. But it shall come to pass at the last of these days I will bring back the captivity of Ailam, saith the Lord.

L. XXXVIII. A word of the Lord which he spake against Babylon.

PROCLAIM among the nations, publish and conceal not—say, Babylon is taken; Bel is confounded; the fearless, the luxurious Mardoch is delivered up. For a nation is gone up against her from the north, which will make her land a desolation, so that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast. In those days, even at that time, shall come up the children of Israel, they and the children of Juda together: walking slow and weeping they will march on seeking the Lord their God. They will ask the way to Zion; for thitherward they will set their face; and they will come and flee to the Lord their God; for the everlasting covenant shall not be forgotten. My people have been lost sheep. Their shepherds caused them to stray. On the mountains they caused them to wander. From mountain to hill they roamed. They forgot their place of rest. All that found them devoured them. Their enemies said, "Let us not spare them because they sinned against the Lord." He who gathered their fathers hath a pasture of righteousness: remove out of Babylon and from the country of the Chaldeans, and go out and be like dragons before sheep. For
lo! I am raising up against Babylon assemblies of nations from the north; and they shall be drawn up in array against her. Thence one shall be taken like the dart of a skilful warrior which shall not rebound in vain. So Chaldea shall be for a prey. All that plunder it shall be satisfied. Because you rejoiced and triumphed when you were plundering my heritage—because you frisked about like calves in a pasture, and brandished your horns like bulls; your mother shall be greatly ashamed: she who brought you forth for prosperity shall be confounded. Being the hindmost of nations, a desert because of the wrath of the Lord, she shall not be inhabited; but shall be entirely a desolation. Sorrow will cover the countenance of all who travel through Babylon; and at all their calamity they will express pity. Set yourselves in array all around against Babylon. All ye who bend the bow shoot at her: spare not your arrows, you must needs subdue her. Her hands are weakened; her bulwarks have fallen, and her wall is undermined. Because it is a vengeance from the Lord; execute vengeance on her. As she hath done, do ye to her. Destroy utterly the seed of Babylon, him who handleth the sickle in harvest. Let them return from the face of the Grecian sword, every one to his own people; and let every one flee to his own land.

Israel was a wandering sheep. Lions scared him away. The first who devoured him was the king of Assur, and this last, the king of Babylon gnawed his bones. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I will execute vengeance on the king of Babylon and his land as I executed vengeance on the king of Assyria. And I will bring back Israel to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel, and on mount Ephraim, and on Galaad; and his soul shall be satisfied. In those days and at that time, search shall be made for the iniquity of Israel; but none shall remain: and for the sins of Juda; but none shall be found. For I will be merciful to them who are left.

With respect to this land, saith the Lord. Go up with bitterness against it and against them who dwell in it; take vengeance, O sword, and destroy utterly; saith the Lord, and do according to all that I command thee.

A sound of battle and great distress in the land of the Chaldeans! How the hammer of the whole earth is broken
and dashed to pieces! How Babylon is become a desolation among the nations! They will come upon thee and thou shalt not know—like Babylon itself and thou shalt be taken. Thou art found out and taken, because thou didst set thyself against the Lord.

25 The Lord hath opened his arsenal and brought out the instruments of his wrath; because the Lord God hath a work to perform in the land of the Chaldeans.

26 Because her time is come; open ye her treasuries, search her like a cave; and destroy her utterly. Let not a remnant of her be left. Lay waste all her fruits and let them go down to destruction.

(p) Alas for them; for their day is come and the time of their visitation! Hark! a sound of men fleeing and escaping out of the land of Babylon to inform Sion of the vengeance of the Lord our God.

29 (J) Issue these orders to many against Babylon—to every one bending a bow—"Encamp against her round about; let none escape out of her." Render to her according to her works—according to all that she hath done, do ye to her. Because she set herself against the Lord, the holy God of Israel, therefore her young men shall fall in her streets and all her mighty warriors shall be laid low, saith the Lord.

31 Behold I am against thee, thou essence of haughtiness, saith the Lord. Because thy day is come and the time of thy punishment; therefore thy haughtiness shall be abated and fall, and none shall continue to support it. For I will kindle a fire in her forest, which shall devour all around her.

33 Thus saith the Lord, The children of Israel and the children of Juda have both been oppressed; all who captivated them tyrannised over them.

34 Because they refused to let them go; therefore their Redeemer—the Mighty One, whose name is The Lord Almighty will plead their cause with their adversaries. In order that he may remove this land out of the way he will sharpen for the inhabitants of Babylon a sword against the Chaldeans and against the inhabitants of Babylon; and against her grandees and against her counsellors—a sword against her warriors and they shall be destroyed; a sword against their horses and
the mixed multitude in the midst of her and they shall be like women—a sword against her treasures; and they shall be rifled; against them who are on her waters and they shall be exposed to shame.

Because it is a land of the graven images and it was in these islands where they boasted therefore imageries shall dwell in those islands and in her shall dwell the daughters of Sirens and she shall never more be inhabited. As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorra and the neighbouring cities, said the Lord, no man shall dwell there, nor shall a son of man make his abode there. Behold a people is coming from the north, even a mighty nation, and many kings shall be roused up from the extremity of the earth handling the bow and sword. They are haughty and will shew no mercy: their voice will roar like the sea. On horses they will come prancing, in array like fire, for battle against thee, O daughter of Babylon. The king of Babylon heard the report of them and his hands were enfeebled; anguish seized him like the pangs of a woman in travail. Behold he will be like the lion which must go up from the swelling of Jordan to Gaitham, for I will speedily drive men from her, and set every youth against her: for who is like me and who can withstand me? And who is the shepherd who can stand before me? Therefore hear the counsel which the Lord hath taken against Babylon; and the determination he is come to against the Chaldean inhabitants, let all but the lambs of the flock be destroyed; let all but a pasture for them be made a desolation. For at the sound of the capture of Babylon the earth shall be shaken, and a scream shall be heard among the nations.

LI. Thus said the Lord. Behold against Babylon and against the Chaldean inhabitants I am raising up a hot destroying wind. 2 And against Babylon I will send scorners who will treat her with scorn and waste her land. Woe shall surround Babylon on all sides on the day of her affliction. Let him, who bendeth the bow, bend it; and him, who hath armour put it on; shew no compassion to her youths, and destroy utterly all her host. And let the wounded fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and those who are pierced through, fall in her streets.

(p) Since Israel and Juda are not quite forsaken by their
God, the Lord Almighty, on account of their land being filled with iniquity by reason of the sanctuaries of Israel; flee out of Babylon and save every one his life and be not involved in her iniquity. For the time of her punishment is come from the Lord, and he is rendering to her a recompence. Babylon was a golden cup in the hand of the Lord, furnishing a plentiful draught to all the nations. Of her wine the nations drank, therefore they reeled. But Babylon is suddenly fallen and broken. Utter a lamentation for her. Get balm for her deadly wound; perhaps she may be cured.

(c) We have administered medicines to Babylon, but she is not healed. Let us leave her and depart every one to his own land: for her judgment hath reached to heaven and mounted up to the stars. The Lord hath published his decree. Come let us proclaim in Sion the works of the Lord our God.

(p) Prepare the arrows. Fill the quivers. The Lord hath stirred up the spirit of the king of the Medes. For his wrath is against Babylon to destroy her utterly. For it is the vengeance of the Lord—the avengement of his people. On the walls of Babylon erect a standard; set the watch; have arms ready. Because the Lord hath undertaken; therefore he will accomplish what he hath spoken against the inhabitants of Babylon—against them who dwell on many waters, and against the multitude of her treasures. Thine end is come, it is come indeed into thy bowels: for the Lord hath sworn by his arm, "I will fill thee with men as with locusts; and they who go down shall utter a sound against thee."

(c) The Lord is he who made the earth by his power, who fitted up the world by his wisdom. By his understanding he stretched out the heaven. At his voice there was in heaven a sound of water, and he brought up clouds from the extremity of the earth. He made the lightning for rain and brought out light from his treasuries. Every man by knowledge became stupefied, every melter of gold was put to shame for his graven images; for their molten images were falschoods, there is no breath in them. They are works of vanity and objects of derision. In the time of their visitation they shall perish. The portion of Jacob is not such as these, for he who formed all things is his inheritance: his name is the Lord.
(J) Thou art dispersing for me implements of war, but in thee I will disperse nations and remove kings out of thee; and in thee I will disperse the horse and his rider; and in thee I will disperse chariots and charioteers; and in thee I will disperse the youth and the virgin; and in thee I will disperse the husband and the wife; and in thee I will disperse the shepherd and the flock; and in thee I will disperse the husbandman and his husbandry; and in thee I will disperse the generals and leaders of armies, and retribute to Babylon and all the Chaldean inhabitants all the evils which they have done to Sion in your sight, saith the Lord. Behold I am against thee, O corrupted mountain which corruptest the whole earth, and I will stretch out my hand against thee and roll thee down on rocks; and I will make thee like a mountain which hath been burned to ashes, so that they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner nor a stone for a foundation. For thou shalt be a desolation for ever, saith the Lord. Erect a standard in the land. Sound a trumpet among the nations. Prepare the nations against her. Issue orders against her. Carry them, O kings, from me even to the Achanazeans. Erect towers against her. Bring up against her, cavalry like a multitude of locusts. Bring up against her nations, the king of the Medes and of the whole earth—his generals and all the leaders of his army.

(p) The earth was in commotion and oppressed with toil, because the determination of the Lord against Babylon had roused it, to make the land of Babylon a desolation and uninhabitable. The warriors of Babylon declined to fight. They will sit still there during a siege. Their mighty power is broken. They are become like women. Her habitations are burned with fire. Her bars are broken. Courier will run to meet courier and messenger to meet messenger to tell the king of Babylon that his city is taken—that the passages one after another are forced—that the barriers are burned with fire and his warriors are fleeing. For thus said the Lord, the houses of the king of Babylon shall be threshed like a floor full of ripe grain. Yet a little while and her harvest will come.

(c) She devoured me; she chewed me to pieces: thick darkness overwhelmed me. Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon
swallowed me down; like a dragon he filled his belly with my dainties. They have cast me up.

35 (p) Let the inhabitants of Sion say, My troubles and my miseries be upon Babylon! and let Jerusalem say, My blood be upon the Chaldean inhabitants!

36 (J) For this cause, thus saith the Lord, Behold I will judge thine adversary and avenge thy cause; and I will drain off her sea and make her fountain dry, and Babylon shall be a desolation and shall not be inhabited. Because they roused together like lions and like lions' whelps; in their heat I will give them a draught and make them drunk; that they may be stupefied and sleep a perpetual sleep and never awake, saith the Lord.

40 (p) Down, down with them, like lambs to slaughter and like rams and he goats. How the boast of the whole earth is hunted and taken! how Babylon has become a desolation among the nations! The sea came up against Babylon with its roaring waves, and she is overwhelmed. Her cities are become like a land without water, an untrodden desert. Not an individual can dwell there: nor can a son of man lodge in her.

44 (J) I will indeed punish Babylon and bring forth out of her mouth what she hath swallowed. And the nations shall no more be gathered together to her; nor shall the victims of the whole earth fall by Babylon. Away from her country, ye who have escaped; and tarry not; ye who are far off, remember the Lord; and let Jerusalem recur to your mind.

51 (c) We are ashamed; because we have heard our reproach, disgrace hath covered our face; strangers have entered our sanctuaries—into the house of the Lord.

52 (J) Therefore behold the days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will execute vengeance on her graven images, and among all them her wounded shall fall in that land. For though Babylon should mount up to heaven—though she fortify her walls with all her might, from me shall come forth those who shall destroy her, saith the Lord.

54 (p) A sound of screaming in Babylon! and great destruction in the land of the Chaldeans! For the Lord hath utterly destroyed Babylon, and put an end to her din, which was like the sound of great waters. Her din he hath given up to destruc-
56 tion. For misery is come upon Babylon. Her warriors are taken. Their bow is confounded; for God rendereth them retribution.

(J) The Lord rendereth them retribution; and he will make utterly drunk her leaders and her wise men and her generals, saith the king whose name is The Lord Almighty.

58 Thus saith the Lord, The wall of Babylon was made broad; It shall be totally demolished and her lofty gates shall be burned with fire; and the peoples shall not labour in vain, though the nations may at first fail.

59 THE word which the Lord commanded Jeremias the prophet to deliver to Saraias son of Nerias son of Maasias when he was going from Sedekias king of Juda to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Saraias had the charge of the homage gifts.

60 When Jeremias had written in a book all the evils which were to come upon Babylon, even all the words above written against Babylon, Jeremias said to Saraias; When thou art come to Babylon and shalt have seen and read all these words, then thou shalt say, "O Lord, Lord, thou hast spoken against this place, that thou wilt destroy it utterly, so that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast; for it shall be a desolation forever." And when thou hast finished reading the book, then thou shalt tye a stone to it and throw it into the midst of the Euphrates, and say, "So shall Babylon sink and rise no more by reason of the evils which I bring upon it.

LII. XXXIX. SEDEKIAS was twenty one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem and his mother's name was Ameital. She was a daughter of Jeremias of Lobena. And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon, came with his whole army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it and built a wall around it of square stones, and the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Sedekias. On the ninth day of the — month there was a grievous famine in the city and there was no bread for the people of the land. When a breach was made into the city,
all the men who were warriors went out by night by the way of the gate between the outer and the inner wall, which was along the king's garden, (though the Chaldeans were all around the city;) and took the road to Araba. And the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him on the borders of Jericho. And all his servants being dispersed from him, they took the king and carried him to the king of Babylon at Deb-latha, who passed sentence on him. And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedekias before his eyes. He slew also all the chiefs of Juda at Deblatha. Then he put out the eyes of Sedekias and bound him with chains. And the king of Babylon led him to Babylon and committed him to the slave prison where he continued till the day of his death.

And on the fifth month on the tenth of the month Nabouzardan the chief cook, who stood in the presence of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem and burned the house of the Lord and the king's house. He burned also with fire all the public buildings of the city and every stately house. And the army of the Chaldeans which was with the chief cook demolished all the wall of Jerusalem round about. But the chief cook left the remains of the people for vine dressers and husbandmen.

The Chaldeans also broke to pieces the pillars of brass which were in the house of the Lord and the bases and the sea of brass which was in the house of the Lord, and took the brass and carried it to Babylon with the crown, and the cups and the flesh forks and all the utensils of brass with which they sacrificed; and the Apphoths and the Masmaroths and the oil vessels and the candlesticks and the censers and the cups: those which were of gold, or gilded, and those which were of silver, or plated, the chief cook took. As for the two pillars and the sea and the twelve oxen of brass under the sea, which king Solomon had made for the house of the Lord, there was no weighing the brass thereof. The height of each of the pillars was thirty five cubits and a fillet of twelve cubits encircled it, the thickness of which was four fingers all around. And there was a chapiter of brass on each of them of the height of five cubits with a ball on the top of each and a piece of net work and pomegranates around on each chapiter; all of brass;
23 eight pomegranates to a cubit for the twelve cubits. So that there were ninety six pomegranates on the sides and all the pomegranates on the net work round about were one hundred.

24 And the chief cook took the chief priest, and the priest who was second to him, and the three who guarded the way; and a eunuch who was over the men of war, and seven men of renown who attended in the king's presence, who were found in the city, and the scribe of the armies, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty chief men, of the people of the country, who were found in the city. These Nabuzardan the chief cook, took and brought to the king of Babylon at Deblatha. And the king of Babylon slew them at Deblatha in the land of Aimath.

31 And it came to pass in the thirty seventh year of the captivity of Jechonias king of Juda, in the twelfth month, on the twenty fourth of the month, Oulaimadachar king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, took and raised up the head of Jechonias king of Juda, and caused him to be shaven and released him from the prison, in which he was confined, and spoke kindly to him and set his seat above the kings, who were with him in Babylon. And changed his prison dress, and caused him to eat in his presence, all the days of his life.

34 And he had a portion continually given to him, day by day, from the king of Babylon, to the day of his death.

THE LAMENTATIONS OF JEREMIAS.

I.

After Israel was carried into captivity, and Jerusalem was laid waste; Jeremias sat down and wept, and sung this song of woe over Jerusalem, and said.

1 HOW solitary sitteth the city which was full of people! she who was abundant among nations is become like a widow! the empress of provinces is become tributary!

2 She wept sore by night and her tears are on her cheeks: and of all her lovers there is none to comfort her. All her friends dealt treacherously with her. They became her enemies.

3 Judea is forced to emigrate. On account of her humiliation and because of her great servitude, she sat down among
the nations; she found no rest. All her persecutors found her among them who were afflicting her.

4 The highways of Sion mourn; because none attend her festivals. All her gates are desolate. Her priests groan bitterly. Her virgins are carried away; and she is by herself in bitterness.

5 They who afflict her are become her head; and her enemies prosper. Because the Lord hath humbled her for the multitude of her transgressions; her children are gone into captivity before the oppressor.

6 From the daughter of Sion all her comeliness is taken away. Her chiefs were like rams which could find no pasture; and they came without strength in view of the pursuer.

7 In the days of her humiliation and rejection, Jerusalem remembered all the good things which she had in days of old. When her people fell into the hands of the oppressor, and there was none to help her; her enemies seeing this, laughed at her festivals held in commemoration of her settlement.

8 Jerusalem sinned grievously, therefore she became unstable as a wave. By all that honoured her she hath been humbled, for they saw her nakedness, while she sighing turned away her face.

9 Her uncleanness was before her feet. She was insensible to her extreme distress. He hath indeed lowered her haughtiness; there is none who comforteth her. O Lord, behold my affliction because the enemy is magnified.

10 On all the objects of her desire the oppressor hath laid his hand; for into her sanctuary, she saw nations entering, concerning whom thou hast commanded that they should not come into thy congregation.

11 All her people were sighing deeply, seeking bread. They gave up the objects of her desire, for meat to preserve life. Look down, O Lord, and see how she is dishonoured.

12 (s) Ho! all ye who travel the way turn and see! is there any sorrow like this of mine, which he hath denounced against me. The Lord hath humbled me in the day of his fierce indignation.

(s) Sion, or the city of Jerusalem.
13 From his loftiness he hath sent a fire; he brought it in among my bones. He hath spread a net for my feet and turned me backwards. He hath made me desolate and full of sorrow, all the live long day.

14 He hath kept a watch on my transgressions. They are wreathed round my hands. They have reached up to my neck. My strength is enfeebled. For into my hands the Lord hath sent pains. I cannot stand.

15 From amidst me the Lord hath removed all my mighty men. He hath brought upon me the time for crushing my chosen bands. The Lord trod out a vat for the virgin daughter of Juda. For these things I mourn. Mine eye hath flowed with water, because my comforter, he who is the supporter of my life, is far removed from me. My children are vanished because the enemy hath prevailed.

17 (p) Sion stretched forth her hand; there is none to comfort her. The Lord gave a command respecting Jacob; around him are they who afflict him. Jerusalem became among them, like one set apart as unclean.

18 (s) The Lord is righteous; for against his express commandment I rebelled. Hear I beseech you all ye peoples and behold my sorrow! my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.

19 I called on my lovers; but they with false excuses deceived me. My priests and my elders expired in the city, because they sought food to support their lives, but found none.

20 Look, O Lord! because of my distress my bowels are troubled; and my heart within me is distracted, because I have grievously rebelled. Abroad the sword, and at home death have bereaved me of children.

21 Hear, I beseech thee! because I groan; there is none to comfort me. All mine enemies heard of my calamities, and rejoiced at what thou hast done. Thou hast brought on a day:

22 thou hast proclaimed a time. They were like me, let all their wickedness come before thee. Make search for them as they have made search for all my transgressions. For my groans are many, and my heart is afflicted with grief.

II. OH! how the Lord hath in his wrath covered with dark-
ness the daughter of Sion! he hath cast down, from heaven, upon the earth, the glory of Israel; and hath not remembered his own footstool.

2 In the day of his indignation the Lord overwhelmed and did not spare; in his wrath he destroyed all the comeliness of Jacob: he levelled to the ground the strong holds of the daughter of Juda. He brought contempt on her king, and her chiefs.

3 In his fierce anger he broke the whole horn of Israel: he turned back his right hand from before his enemy: he kindled in Jacob a flaming fire, which devoured all around.

4 He bent his bow like an opposing enemy—like an adversary he strengthened his right hand and slew all the desires of mine eyes. In the tent of the daughter of Sion he poured out his wrath like fire.

5 The Lord became like an enemy. He overwhelmed Israel. He sunk her palaces. He destroyed his own munitions, and multiplied on the daughter of Juda humiliation on humiliation.

6 He laid open like a vineyard his own dwelling; he marred his own festivals. The Lord forgot the festivals and sabbaths which he had established in Sion, and by the rebuke of his anger vexed king and priest and chief.

7 The Lord hath cast off his altar; he hath shaken off his sanctuary. With the hand of an enemy he hath demolished the wall of her palaces. They uttered a shout in the house of the Lord as on the day of a festival.

8 He turned back to destroy the wall of the daughter of Sion; he stretched out a measuring line: he withdrew not his hand from destruction; so the outer wall mourned and the inner wall languished with it.

9 Her gates were dashed to the ground: he destroyed and broke to pieces her bars, her king and her chiefs among the nations. Law is no more; and her prophets saw not a vision from the Lord.

10 The elders of the daughter of Sion sat on the ground. They were silent. They heaped dust on their heads; they girded themselves with sackcloth. He humbled to the ground the virgin princesses in Jerusalem.

11 Mine eyes failed with tears; my heart was astounded. My glory was poured on the ground for the distress of the daugh-
ter of my people when the infant and suckling expired in the streets of the city.

12 To their mothers they said, "Where is corn and wine," when they were fainting like wounded men in the streets of the city—when they were pouring out their souls in their mothers' bosom.

13 What shall I take to witness for thee? Or to what shall I liken thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? Who can save and comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Sion? Because thy cup of ruin hath been large, who can heal thee?

14 Thy prophets saw vanities and follies for thee; they made no revelations against thine iniquity to turn away thy captivity, but saw for thee false burdens and expellings.

15 All that passed by clapped their hands for thee, they expressed the sound of pity and shaked their heads for the daughter of Jerusalem. Is this, say they, the city, the crown of joy of the whole earth!

16 Against thee all thine enemies opened their mouth; they hissed and gnashed their teeth and said, We have swallowed her up; but this is the day we looked for; we have found it; we have seen it.

17 The Lord hath done what he purposed. He hath executed his decree, what he enjoined in days of old. He hath destroyed and hath not spared. He hath caused an enemy to rejoice over thee. He hath exalted the horn of thine oppressor. Their heart cried to the Lord. O! walls of Sion cause tears to flow down like a torrent day and night. Give thyself no rest; let not the daughter of thine eyes be silent. Arise, chant praise in the night at setting thy watch. Pour out thy heart like water before the Lord; lift up thy hands to him for the life of thine infants, who are perishing with hunger at the head of every street.

20 Look, O Lord, and see. For whom hast thou caused such a search to be made? Shall women eat the fruit of their womb! The cook hath made search! Shall infants at the breast be butchered? Wilt thou slay in the sanctuary of the Lord, priest and prophet?

21 On the high way lie the youth and the elder. My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity; with sword and with famine thou hast slain; in the day of thine anger thou hast slaughtered and hast not spared.
22 He called my sojourners from all around to a solemn festival, so that in the day of the indignation of the Lord none escaped or were left. As I excelled in power so have I multiplied all mine enemies.

III. I AM a man who have seen affliction by the rod of his wrath against me. He hath seized me and dragged me into darkness and there is no light. But still he turned his hand against me all the day long.

4 He hath made my flesh and my skin old; he hath broken my bones. He built up against me and encompassed my head and afflicted it with pain: in dark mansions he placed me like the dead of old.

7 He built up against me so that I cannot get out. He made my chain heavy. Though I scream and cry, he shut out my prayer. He walled up my ways; he blocked up my paths; he terrified me.

10 He was as a bear lying in wait; to me he was like a lion in secret coverts. He pursued me when I fled and stopped me.

12 He removed me quite out of sight. He bent his bow and set me up as a mark for his arrow. He poured into my reins the darts of his quiver.

14 I became a subject of laughter to all my people—their song all the day long. He glutted me with wormwood; he gave me a large draught of gall, and broke my teeth with gravel. He drenched me with ashes. He removed my soul far from peace. I forgot prosperity; so my strength was destroyed and the hope which I had from the Lord. I recollected because of mine affliction. When by reason of persecution, my bitterness and gall shall be remembered; then on myself will my soul meditate. I will lay this up in my heart. On this account I will wait for the mercies of the Lord, because he hath not quite forsaken me—because his compassion is not exhausted. In the ensuing months, O Lord, exercise compassion, since we are not quite consumed—since thy mercies are not exhausted. New every morning is thine abundant faithfulness. The Lord is my portion, saith my soul, therefore I will wait for him. The Lord is gracious to them who wait for him; for the soul, that will seek him, there is good; let it therefore wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord. It is good for a man
28 when he hath borne a yoke in his youth. He will sit solitary and be silent, because he hath taken it upon him. He will give his cheek to him who smiteth it; he will feed on reproaches; because the Lord will not cast off forever—because he who hath humbled will have compassion, even according to the multitude of his mercies. He did not answer from his heart and humble the children of men with an intent to crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth; to turn aside the cause of man from before the Most High. To condemn a man when he is on his trial, the Lord hath not enjoined.

37 (a) Who ever enjoined thus; when it hath happened, hath not the Lord ordered it?

38 (b) From the mouth of the Most High shall not ills proceed as well as good? Why should a living man murmur—a man for his sin offering? Our way hath been searched and tried; let us then return to the Lord. Let us offer up our hearts on our hands to Him who is High in heaven. We have sinned; we have been guilty of impiety; and thou hast not been appeased. Thou hast covered with wrath and discarded us; thou hast slain and hast not spared; thou hast covered thyself with a cloud because of prayer, that I may shut mine eyes and be cast off. Thou hast placed us in the midst of the peoples; all our enemies have opened their mouths against us. On us are come terror and wrath, desolation and destruction. Let streams of water be collected by mine eye, for the destruction of the daughter of my people. Mine eye is bathed in tears and I cannot keep silence that it may dry, until the Lord look down from heaven and behold. Let mine eye be more watchful for my life, than all the daughters of a city. With eagerness all mine enemies have hunted me like an ostrich; without cause they have condemned me to die in a dungeon, and placed a stone over me. Water was poured above upon my head. I said, I am cast off. I called on thy name, O Lord, out of the deepest dungeon. Thou hast heard my voice; stop not thine ear against my supplication. To my assistance thou didst draw near. On the day I called on thee, thou saidst to me, Fear not.

(a) An objection. (b) The answer.
58 Thou, O Lord, hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. Thou, O Lord, hast seen my wrongs; thou hast decided my cause. Thou hast seen all their vengeance—into all their devices against me. Thou hast heard their reproach—all their charges against me—the speeches of them who accused me; their studied harangues against me all the day long. At their sitting down and their rising up, look down on their eyes. Thou, O Lord, wilt render them a recompence according to the works of their hands. Thou wilt give them for a shield the sorrow of my heart. Thou wilt pursue them with indignation, and destroy them utterly from under heaven.

IV. HOW gold can be tarnished! How pure silver can be changed! Holy stones were shot down at the head of all the outlets.

2 The sons of Sion who were precious, more precious than gold; how they have been accounted as earthen vessels, the works of a potter’s hands.

3 Surely jackals drew out the breasts; their whelps suckled the daughters of my people, to make them unnatural as the ostrich in the desert.

4 The tongue of a sucking babe cleaved to the roof of its mouth for thirst: infants asked for bread, there is none who breaketh it for them.

5 They who had fed upon dainties perished in the highways; they who had been nursed in scarlet were covered with dung.

6 The transgression of the daughter of my people was greater than that of Sodom which was overthrown suddenly, without tiring hands with it.

7 Her Nazarites were purer than snow; they were whiter than milk. They were more ruddy than a sapphire. Behold their change!

8 Their visage became blacker than soot. They are not distinguished in the streets. Their skin is shrivelled to their bones. They are withered. They are become like a stick.

9 The victims of the sword are more beautiful than those slain by famine. These stalked about pierced through for want of the fruits of the field.

10 The hands of tender-hearted women boiled their own children; these were food for them in the extreme distress of the daughter of my people.
11 The Lord hath executed his wrath—he hath poured out his fierce anger. He hath kindled a fire in Sion, which hath devoured her very foundations.

12 The kings of the earth; all the inhabitants of the world did not believe that an enemy and a destroyer could have entered the gates of Jerusalem.

13 Because of the sins of her prophets; the iniquities of her priests; of them who were shedding innocent blood, in the midst of her, (her watchmen shuddered in the streets, they were polluted with blood, as they could not but have touched their clothes. "Stand off from the unclean." Call to them "Stand off! Stand off! touch not" because they had been touched they shuddered.) Say among the nations, Let them no longer sojourn there.

15 The presence of the Lord was their portion; he will no more look upon them: they paid no respect to the presence of priests; on prophets they had no compassion.

17 While we yet existed our eyes failed looking in vain for our help. When we looked out, we looked to a nation that could not save.

18 We have hunted for our little ones that they might not walk in our streets. Our time is come. Our days are fulfilled. Our time is at hand.

19 They who pursue us are swifter than eagles in the air; they overtook us on the mountains. They lay in wait for us in the desert.

20 In their slaughters is comprehended the breath of our nostrils, our anointed Lord, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.

21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Idumea who dwellest in the land. To thee however the cup of the Lord will come and thou shalt drink and vomit.

22 O daughter of Sion, thine iniquity is done away. He will no more banish thee. He hath visited thine iniquities, O daughter of Edom. He hath exposed thee for thy sins.

V. REMEMBER, O Lord, what hath befallen us: look down and behold our reproach. Our inheritance is transferred to strangers; our houses to foreigners. We are become orphans. Our
4 father is no more. Our mothers are like widows. Our water we have drunk for money. Our wood came by barter on our shoulders. We have been persecuted. We have laboured and have had no rest. Egypt laid to a hand; Assyria, till they were satisfied. Our fathers sinned; they are no more. We have borne their transgressions. Slaves have got dominion over us; there is none to deliver us out of their hand. At the peril of our lives we must gather in our corn, because of the sword of the desert. Our skin is black as an oven. They are shrivelled up by storms of famine. Our wives are humbled in Sion; our virgins in the cities of Juda. Our chiefs were hanged up by their hands; our elders were held in no esteem. Our warriors took up a lamentation; and our youths fainted under a club. Our elders have ceased to attend at the gates, and our chosen men have ceased from their songs. The joy of our heart is at an end; our dance is turned into mourning. Our crown is fallen from our head; alas for us! for we have sinned. Because of this, grief is come upon us—our heart is full of sorrow: because of this, our eyes are dim. On mount Sion, because it is desolate, foxes have walked about. But thou, O Lord, wilt inhabit it forever: thy throne is for all generations. Why wilt thou utterly forget us? Wilt thou leave us for length of days? Turn us to thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned and renew our days as heretofore. Because thou wast cast off, thou hast cast us off; thou hast been provoked against us to a high degree.

EZEEKIEL.

I. In the thirtieth year, and fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was among the captives by the river Chobar, the heavens were opened and I saw the visions of God. On the fifth of that month (this was the fifth year of the captivity of king Jechonias) the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel son of Buzi the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chobar. And the hand of the Lord was upon me, and I looked, and lo! a whirlwind came from the north, and with it a great cloud surrounded with a splendor of flashing fire; and in the midst thereof, an appearance like that of am-
5 ber in the middle of the fire, and a splendor in it. And in the middle, a resemblance like that of four living beings. And this was the appearance of them. They had a resemblance of a man in them. And each had four faces, and each had four wings; and their legs were straight and their feet winged and sparkling like sparkling brass. And their wings had a quick motion. And underneath their wings on their four sides was a man's hand. And the faces of the four turned not when they went. They marched forward each having a face on every side. And with regard to the similitude of their faces, the four had the face of a man with the face of a lion, on the right; and on the left the four had the face of a bullock, and the four had a face of an eagle. And the wings of the four were expanded upwards, each having a pair expanded adjoining each other and a pair folded on their body. And they moved on, each straight forward, which way soever the wind was moving, they moved on, and turned not. And in the midst of the four living beings, was an appearance like that of glowing coals of fire, resembling lamps whirling round between the living beings with a splendor of fire, and from the fire lightnings flashed. And I beheld and lo! on the ground, close to the four living beings a wheel! one to every of the four.—And the appearance of the wheels was like the appearance of a beryl. And the four had one and the same likeness. And their workmanship was as if there was a wheel within a wheel. They ran on their four sections and shifted not their position when they ran, nor did their felloes when they were elevated. And I beheld, and their felloes were full of eyes, all around the four. And when the living beings moved on, the wheels moved on close by them. And when the living beings mounted up from the earth, the wheels mounted up. Wherever the cloud was, there was the wind for their movement; the wheels moved on and were carried aloft with them. Because there was a breath of life in the wheels, when the living beings moved on, the wheels moved on: when those stood still, these stood still: and when those mounted up from the earth, these mounted up with them, because there was a breath of life in the wheels. And over the head of the living beings, there was a likeness resembling a
firmament, like the appearance of chrystal over their wings, which were expanded above them. And their wings which were expanded below the firmament, flapped one against another, while every one had a pair that covered their bodies.—And when they moved on I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of much water: but when they stopped, their wings were still. And lo! a voice from above the firmament! this being over their heads, there was an appearance like that of a sapphire stone and a resemblance of a throne upon it. And upon the resemblance of the throne a resemblance like the appearance of a man above. And I saw a resemblance of amber from the appearance of the loins and upwards; and from the appearance of the loins and downwards, I saw an appearance of fire: and the splendor thereof round about was like the bow which is in the clouds in a showery day. Such was the state of the splendor round about.

II. THIS was the vision of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell on my face and I heard a voice of one speaking and he said to me, Son of man, stand on thy feet and I will speak to thee. Whereupon a blast of wind came upon me and took me and lifted me up and set me on my feet and I heard him speaking to me and he said to me,

Son of man, I am about to send thee to the house of Israel, to them who are provoking me; who have provoked me, both they and their fathers even to this day. And thou shalt say unto them, "Thus saith the Lord," whether they hear or be affrighted; (for they are a provoking house) and let them know that thou art a prophet among them. And thou son of man, be not afraid of them nor daunted at their presence. Because they will sting thee and rise up against thee on all sides and thou dwellest in the midst of scorpions, be not afraid of their words nor terrified at their looks—because they are a provoking house, therefore thou shalt deliver my words to them whether they hear or be affrighted.

Because they are a provoking house, thou therefore, son of man, hear him who is speaking to thee and be not thou rebellious like this rebellious house. Open thy mouth and eat what I give thee.

Then I looked, and lo! a hand stretched out towards me
and in it a roll of a book and he unfolded it before me and there were writings on it on both sides. And the writings were funeral odes and songs of woe.

III. And he said to me, Son of man eat this roll and go and speak to the children of Israel. And when he had opened my mouth and put the roll into it, he said to me, Son of man, Let thy mouth eat and thy belly be filled with this roll which is given thee. So I ate it, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey. Then he said to me, Son of man, go and get thee to the house of Israel and speak to them these words of mine, seeing thou art sent to the house of Israel—not to a people of strange language, nor to many tribes of strange and foreign tongues, nor to them whose pronunciation is harsh and whose words thou canst not understand; though had I sent thee to such they might have hearkened to thee. But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee, since they are not willing to hearken to me. Because all the house of Israel are contentious and stubborn, therefore behold I have made thy face strong against their faces, and I will invigorate thy struggle against their struggling and it shall be on all occasions firmer than a rock. Be not afraid of them nor daunted at their countenance, because they are a provoking house. Then he said to me, Son of man, lay up in thy heart all the words which I have spoken to thee; and having heard with thine ears go get thee to the captivity, to the children of thy people, and thou shalt speak to them and say to them, "Thus saith the Lord," whether they hear or forbear.

12 Then a blast of wind took me up and I heard behind me a sound of a great earthquake, "Blessed be the glory of the Lord from this place of his:" whereupon I looked towards the sound and saw that this sound of an earthquake was that of the wings flapping one against another and that of the wheels near them. Then the blast lifted me up and bore me aloft and I went by the impulse of my own spirit, and the hand of the Lord upon me was strong, and being borne aloft I came to the captivity and went round among them who dwelt by the river Chobar—among them who were there. And I abode there seven days conversing with them.

16 And after these seven days a word of the Lord came to me
17 saying, Son of man; I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear a word from my mouth
18 and warn them from me. When I say to the unrighteous, Thou shalt surely die, and thou hast not warned the unrighteous to turn from his ways that he may live; that unrighteous man shall die for his iniquity; but his blood I will require at thy hand. But if thou hast warned the unrighteous and he will not turn from his iniquity and from his way; that unrighteous man shall die for his iniquity, and thou shalt deliver thy soul. So when a righteous man turneth from his righteous acts and shall commit transgression though I lay the punishment before him; he shall die. Because thou hast not warned him, though he indeed shall die for his sins (for his righteous acts will not be remembered;) yet his blood I will require at thy hand. But if thou hast warned the righteous man not to sin and he sinneth not; the righteous man shall live; and because thou hast warned him, thou shalt deliver thy soul.
22 Then the hand of the Lord was upon me; and he said to me, Arise and go out to the plain and I will there speak to thee. So I arose and went out to the plain; and behold the glory of the Lord stood there like the vision and like the glory of the Lord which I saw by the river Chobar. Whereupon I fell on my face. And a blast of wind came upon me and set me on my feet, and he spoke to me and said to me, Go and shut thyself up in thy house. Now son of man, behold chains are prepared for thee; and thou shalt be bound with them and shalt not get out of them. And I will bind up thy tongue, that thou mayst be dumb and not be to them a reproof, because they are a rebellious house. And when I speak to thee, I will open thy mouth and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord, whoso heareth let him hear; and let him who is disobedient, be disobedient, since they are a rebellious house. And thou son of man, take thee a tile and set it before thee and pourtray thereon the city Jerusalem; and thou shalt lay siege to it and build mounts against it and throw up a circumvallation around it and pitch camps against it and arrange the towers for engines round about. Then take thee an iron pan and place it as an iron wall between thee and the city and set thy face against it and it shall be besieged and thou shalt besiege it. This is a
sign for the children of Israel. And thou shalt lie on thy left side and lay on it the iniquities of the house of Israel. According to the number of the hundred and fifty days which thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquities. Now I have given thee their iniquities to the number of a hundred and ninety days. So when thou hast taken the iniquities of the house of Israel and finished them, thou shalt lie on thy right side and bear the iniquities of the house of Juda forty days. I have given thee a day for a year. Therefore thou shalt prepare thy face for the siege of Jerusalem and strengthen thine arm and prophesy against it. And behold I have given chains for thee that thou mayst not turn from one of thy sides to the other until the days of thy siege are accomplished. Provide therefore for thyself wheat and barley and beans and lentiles and millet and rye and put them into an earthen vessel and make them into loaves for thyself according to the number of the days which thou liest on thy side, to be eaten in the course of a hundred and ninety days. And thou shalt eat thy bread by weight, twenty shekels a day. From time to time thou shalt eat it: and thou shalt drink water by measure, namely the sixth of an hin to be drunk at stated times. And thou shalt eat the loaves baked like barley cakes on the hearth, and thou shalt bake them in their sight with a fire made of human ordure and shalt say, Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, So shall the children of Israel eat impure meats among the nations. Upon this I said, Not so: O Lord God of Israel, seeing my soul hath not been polluted with impurity. Even from my birth to this day I have not eaten what died of itself, or was torn by wild beasts, nor hath any tainted flesh ever entered my mouth. Thereupon he said to me, Behold I have given thee the dung of cattle instead of human ordure that thou mayst bake thy loaves with it. Moreover he said to me, son of man, Behold I break the staff of bread in Jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight and with scantiness; and they shall drink water by measure and with faintness; that they may be in want of bread and water and perish, one and all, and be wasted away for their iniquities.

V. And thou son of man, take thee a knife sharper than a barber's razor and having procured such a one thou shalt pass it over thy head and thy beard. Then thou shalt take a pair of
2 scales; and having weighed the hair thou shalt burn the fourth part of it with fire, in the space before the city; during the completion of the days of the siege. And thou shalt take another fourth part and burn it in the midst of the city; and thou shalt hack with the sword another fourth part, around the city; and the other fourth part thou shalt scatter to the wind and I will draw out a sword after them. But of this parcel thou shalt take a few in number and tie them up in thy mantle. Yet even of these thou shalt take some and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them with fire which shall come out of the city and thou shalt say to all the house of Israel thus saith the Lord, This is Jerusalem. I placed her in the midst of nations and the countries around her, that thou shouldst tell my rules of rectitude to such of the nations as are without law; and that mine ordinances might be the ordinances of the countries around her. Because they rejected my rules of rectitude and did not walk by mine ordinances; therefore thus saith the Lord, Because you have taken your bent from the nations around you, and have not walked in my statutes, nor practised my rules of rectitude, nor acted even conformably to the moral precepts of the nations around you; therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I am against thee; and in the midst of thee I will execute judgment in the sight of the nations, and do to thee according to all thine abominations, what I have not done, and the like of which I will not do any more. For this cause fathers shall eat children in the midst of thee; and children shall eat fathers. And I will execute judgment upon thee, and scatter all the remnant of thee to every wind. For this cause, as I live saith the Lord, Because thou hast polluted my holy things with all thine abominations; therefore I will cast thee off; mine eye shall not spare nor will I have compassion. The fourth part of thee shall be consumed with pestilence; and the fourth part of thee shall perish by famine in the midst of thee; and the fourth part of thee shall fall by the sword around thee; and I will make bare a sword to pursue them. And my wrath shall be spent, and mine indignation, on them; and thou shalt know why I the Lord have spoken in my zeal, when I have executed mine indignation on them. And I will make thee and thy daughters
around thee, a desolation, in the sight of every one who passeth by. And thou shalt be an object of lamentation and horror to the nations around thee, when I have executed judgment on thee with mine avenging wrath: I the Lord have spoken. For when I have sent against them my shafts of famine and they shall be for destruction, I will break thy staff of bread and send against thee famine and wild beasts; and punish thee; and death and blood shall pass through upon thee: and I will bring a sword against thee from all around; I the Lord have spoken.

VI. II. AGAIN a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man set thy face against the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them and thou shalt say,
3 O mountains of Israel, hear a word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord to the mountains and hills, and to the vales and the forests, Behold I am bringing a sword against you; and your high places shall be destroyed; and your altars and your temples shall be trodden down; and I will cast down your slain before your idols; and scatter your bones around your altars and in all your dwelling places. The cities shall be laid waste and the high places desolated, that your altars may be utterly destroyed: and your idols shall be trampled down, when your fanes are removed; and your wounded shall fall in the midst of you; and you shall know that I am the Lord. When some of you, who have escaped from the sword, are among the nations and in your dispersions through the countries; then shall those of you, who have escaped, remember me among the nations whither they have been carried captives. With their heart which is going a whoring from me, and with their eyes, which are going a whoring after their own devices(I have sworn) they shall bewail themselves for all their abominations and acknowledge that I the Lord have spoken.
11 Thus saith the Lord, Clap with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Ha! ha! to all the abominations of the house of Israel. By sword and by pestilence, and by famine they shall fall. He who is near shall fall by the sword; and he who is far off, shall die by pestilence; and he who is besieged shall be consumed by famine. And I will accomplish my fury
13 on them. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when your slain are in the midst of your idols, around your altars, on every lofty mount, and under every shady tree, where they offered a sweet smelling savour to all their idols. For I will stretch forth my hand against them; and make the land a desolation and a scene of destruction, from the wilderness of Deblatha through all their habitations; and you shall know that I am the Lord.

VII. III. AGAIN a word of the Lord came to me saying,
2 And thou son of man say, Thus saith the Lord, To the land of Israel an end is coming. The end is come upon the four wings of the land. The end is coming on thee who inhabitest the land. The time is come. The day hath approached, not with commotions nor with pangs. Now near at hand I pour out mine indignation on thee; and upon thee I will spend my wrath; and judge thee for thy ways, and retribute to thee all thine abominations. Mine eye shall not spare, nor will I have compassion. Because I will retribute to thee thy ways, when thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; therefore thou shalt know that it is I the Lord who smite thee. Now the end is upon thee. I will send it against thee, and punish thee for thy ways and retribute to thee all thine abominations.
4 Mine eye shall not spare, nor will I have compassion. Because I will recompense upon thee thy ways, when thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; therefore thou shalt acknowledge that I am the Lord. For thus saith the Lord, Lo! the end is coming. Behold it is the day of the Lord. If indeed the rod hath budded, pride hath come to a full growth.—Therefore he will break the stay of the unrighteous; but not with commotion nor with perturbation. The end is come. Behold the day! let not him who purchaseth rejoice, nor him who selleth, mourn; since he who purchaseth shall no more return to him who selleth. Nor will any man hold with an eye to life. Sound the trumpet and pass sentence on all together. Abroad let there be battle with the sword, and at home famine and pestilence. Let him who is in the field die by the sword; and them in the city let famine and pestilence destroy. Now shall they escape who escape from among
them? When they shall be on the mountains, I will indeed slay all, every one for his iniquities.

17 All hands shall be enfeebled and all thighs stained with filth.
18 And they shall gird on sackcloth; and amazement shall cover them. And shame shall be on all their faces: and on every head, baldness. Their silver shall be thrown in the streets; and their gold shall be disregarded. Their souls shall not be satisfied; nor shall their bellies be filled: because the punishment of their iniquities is come. With their choice apparel which was laid by for ostentation—even with this they adorned the images of their abominations; therefore I have given it to them for defilement—even into the hand of strangers I will deliver it for plunder, and to be a spoil for the ravagers of the earth; and they shall defile it. And I will turn away my face from them; and they shall pollute the places under my peculiar inspection, and come into them unobserved, and profane them and make them an abomination. Because the land is full of peoples, and the city is full of iniquity; therefore I will turn back their tumultuous power, and their holy things shall be polluted. Though an atonement shall come and seek peace, it shall be no more. Woe shall succeed woe; and news be followed by news; and a vision shall be sought from a prophet: and law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders—the chief shall be clothed with darkness; and the hands of the people of the land shall be weakened. According to their ways I will deal with them; and for their crimes I will punish them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.

VIII. IV. AGAIN in the sixth year in the fifth month, on the fifth of the month as I was sitting at home, and the elders of Juda, were sitting before me, the hand of the Lord came upon me. And I looked and lo! a likeness of a man! From his loins downward was fire, and from his loins upward was an appearance like that of amber. And he stretched forth the similitude of a hand and took hold of me by the crown of the head and a blast of wind lifted me up between heaven and earth, and in a vision of God, brought me to Jerusalem, to the vestibule of the gate facing the north, where
4 was the pillar of the possessor. And behold the glory of the Lord God of Israel was there, such in appearance as I saw
5 in the plain. And he said to me, Son of man, look up with thine eyes towards the north. So I looked up with mine eyes towards the north, and behold from the north to the gate
6 facing the east. **. And he said to me, Son of man hast thou seen what they are doing, They are committing great iniquities here that they may abstain from my holy things: but
7 thou shalt see still greater iniquities. Then he led me into the vestibule of the court, and said to me, Son of man, dig.
8 So I digged and lo! a door. And he said to me, Go in and
9 see the transgressions which they are committing here. So I
10 went in and beheld, and lo! vain abominations and all the idols
11 of the house of Israel portrayed upon them round about and seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and Jechonias the son of Saphan in the midst stood foremost, and every one had a censer in his hand, and the smoke of the incense ascended. And he said to me, Hast thou seen, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel are doing, every one of them in this
13 hidden apartment of theirs? For they said, The Lord doth not see. The Lord hath forsaken this land. Then he said to me, thou shalt see still greater transgressions which they are committing. Then he led me to the vestibule of the gate of the house of the Lord facing the north, and behold here were women seated, singing mournful ditties to Thammuz. And he said to me, Son of man, hast thou seen? Thou shalt see still worse devices than these. Then he led me into the inner court of the house of the Lord; and at the vestibule of the temple of the Lord, between the ailams and the altar, were about twenty men; their backs to the temple of the Lord, and their faces the direct contrary way; and they were worshipping the sun.
17 And he said to me, Hast thou seen? Son of man. Is it a light thing for the house of Juda to commit the transgressions, which they have committed here? Because they have filled the land with iniquity, and lo! they are as it were insulting me to my

** Here something seems to be wanting. I apprehend, it was the people sacrificing to idols on the house tops.
18 face; therefore I will deal with them with wrath. Mine eye shall not spare, nor will I have compassion.

IX. Then in my hearing he cried with a loud voice and said,
The punishment of this city is at hand, and every one hath in his hand the instruments of the destruction. Thereupon behold there came from the way of the high gate, which faceth the north, six men, every one with his battle axe in his hand; and in the midst of them a man clothed in a long robe and a girdle of sapphire about his loins. And when they came close to the brazen altar, the glory of the God of Israel which was upon the cherubims ascended from them and came to the open part of the house and called the man who was clothed with the long robe and who had a girdle about his loins, and said to him, Go through the midst of Jerusalem and put a mark on the forehead of those men who are sighing and sorrowing for all the transgressions which are committed among them; and to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye after him into the city and smite and spare not with your eyes nor shew compassion. Destroy utterly old men and young, virgins and infants and married women; but go not near any of those who have the mark on them. Begin at my sanctuary. So they began with the men the elders who were in the house. And he said to them, Defile this house and fill the ways with dead as you are going out and continue the slaughter. And while they were slaying them I fell on my face and cried aloud and said, Ah! Lord! art thou utterly destroying the remnant of Israel by pouring out thy wrath on Jerusalem? Whereupon he said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Juda is exceeding great. Because the land is filled with many peoples and the city is filled with iniquity and impurity—and because they said, the Lord hath forsaken this land; the Lord doth not see; therefore mine eye shall not spare nor will I have compassion. I have requited their ways upon their heads. Then, lo! the man who was clothed with the long robe and girded about the loins with the girdle came and made report, saying, I have done as thou orderedst me. Thereupon I looked, and behold above the firmament which was over the head of the cherubims, there was a resem-
2 blance of a throne above them like a sapphire stone.* And he said to the man who was clothed with the long robe, Go in between the wheels which are under the cherubims and fill thy hands with coals of fire from the midst of the cherubims and scatter them over the city. So in my sight he went in.

3 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house as a man goeth in, and the cloud filled the inner court. And the glory of the Lord had removed from the cherubims to the open part of the house and the cloud filled the house and the court

5' was filled with the splendour of the glory of the Lord: and the sound of the wings of the cherubims was heard to the outer

6 court like the voice of God Saddai speaking. And when he had given orders to the man clothed with the holy robe, saying, Take fire from the midst of the wheels from between the

7 cherubims and he had gone in and stood near the wheels, one stretched out his hand into the midst of the fire, which was between the cherubims and took and put it into the hands of him who was clothed with the holy robe and he took it and

8 went out. Now I saw that the cherubims had the likeness of

9 men's hands under their wings. I looked also and lo! four wheels stood close to the cherubims, one wheel close to each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like the appearance of a carbuncle stone. And as for their appearance, the four had one and the same likeness, as if there was a wheel

11 within a wheel. When they ran, they ran on their four sections.

12 They altered not their position when they ran, for which way soever the foremost looked, they ran and altered not their

13 position when they ran. Now their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes all around

15 the four wheels. And in my hearing these wheels were called Gelgel. And the cherubims were the same living being

16 which I saw by the river Chobar. And when the cherubims marched on, the wheels ran and kept close to them; and when the cherubims lifted up their wings and were borne aloft from the earth, their wheels altered not their position.

17 When those stood these stood; and when those mounted up

* Here also some words seem to be wanting, which pointed out him who sat on the throne.
these mounted up with them, for there was a breath of life in them. Then the glory of the Lord went out from the house and mounted up upon the cherubims; and the cherubims raised their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight. When they went out the wheels were close by them. And they stopped at the vestibule of the gate of the house of the Lord which was over against the house and the glory of the God of Israel was above over them. This was the living being which I saw under the God of Israel at the river Chobar, and I knew that it was the cherubims. Every one had four faces, and every one had eight wings, and the likeness of mens' hands under their wings. And as for the likeness of their faces, these were the same faces which I saw under the glory of the God of Israel at the river Chobar and they marched every one straight forward. Then a blast of wind took me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the Lord which was directly in front and which faced the east. And behold at the vestibule of the gate about five and twenty men! And I saw in the midst of them Jechonias the son of Ezer and Phaltias the son of Banaias, the leaders of the people. And the Lord said to me, son of man, these are the men who devise vanities and who give bad advice in the city, Who say, Are not the houses lately rebuilt? This is the cauldron, but we are the flesh. Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, Son of man. Thereupon the spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me, Say, Thus saith the Lord, Thus have you spoken, O house of Israel, for I know the counsels of your mind: you have multiplied your dead in this city, and filled the highways with the slain: therefore thus saith the Lord, your dead men whom you have slain in the midst of it, they are the flesh and it is the cauldron. As for you I will drag you out of the midst of it. You are afraid of the sword, therefore I will bring a sword against you, saith the Lord, and drag you out of the midst of it and deliver you into the hands of strangers and execute judgment upon you. By the sword you shall fall. On the mountain of Israel I will judge you; and you shall know that I am the Lord.

And it came to pass while I was prophesying that Phaltias the son of Banaias died, whereupon I fell on my face and
cried with a loud voice and said, Alas! Alas! O Lord, art thou making an utter end of the remnant of Israel? Upon which a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, an end was put to thy brethren and to the men of thy captivity and to all the house of Israel, to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem said, Away with you far from the Lord: to us this land is given for an inheritance. Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord, I will drive these away to the nations and scatter them to every land. But I will be to those a little sanctuary in all the countries to which they have come. Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord, I will take those in from among the nations and collect them from the countries in which I have dispersed them and give them the land of Israel and they shall come hither and remove all its abominations and all its iniquities out of it; and I will give them another heart and put a new spirit in them; and I will take away the stony heart out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh that they may walk in my statutes and keep my judgments and execute them. And they shall be my people and I will be their God. But as the heart of these was entirely devoted to their abominations and their iniquities, I have requited their ways upon their heads, saith the Lord. Then the cherubims raised their wings and the wheels were close by them and the glory of the God of Israel was above over them. And the glory of the Lord ascended up out of the midst of the city and halted on the mountain which was over against the city. And a blast of wind took me up and brought me to the land of the Chaldeans, to the captivity, in a vision, by the spirit of God. And I went up on account of the vision which I saw and spoke to all the captivity all the things which the Lord had shewn me.

XII. V. AGAIN a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of these unrighteous men, who have eyes to see but do not see; and have ears to hear, but do not hear. Because they are a rebellious house, do thou therefore, son of man, provide thyself utensils for a day of captivity, in their sight. And thou shalt be carried captive from this place of thine to another place, in their sight, that they
4 may see. Because they are a rebellious house, therefore thou shalt carry out thy utensils, the utensils for a day of captivity, before their eyes. And thou shalt go out in the evening in their sight, as a captive goeth out. Make for thyself a breach in the wall and thou shalt go out through that, in their sight. Thou shalt be taken up upon shoulders and shalt go out in a secret manner. Thou shalt cover thy face and not see the ground, for I have made thee a sign for the house of Israel.

7 So when I had done according to all that he had commanded me; and had carried out utensils for a day of captivity, and made in the evening a breach for myself in the wall, and had gone out in a concealed manner, being taken up upon shoulders in their sight; a word of the Lord came to me in the morning, saying, Son of man, Did not the house of Israel, that rebellious house, say to thee, What art thou doing? Say respecting them, Thus saith the Lord, Lord—With respect to him who is the chief, and the ruler in Jerusalem, even to all the house of Israel, who are among them say, I am acting signs. As I have done, so shall it be with them. They shall go into banishment and captivity. And the chief in the midst of them shall be carried upon shoulders. He will go out in a secret manner through the wall; and a breach will be made for him to go out through it. He will cover his face that he may not be seen and he himself shall not see the ground. But I will spread my net over him and he shall be caught in my enclosure. And I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans; but he shall not see it and he shall die there. And all his helpers about him, and all them who assist him, I will scatter to every wind and make bare a sword to pursue them: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have dispersed them among the nations.

16 For I will disperse them through the countries and leave a few of them from the sword, and from famine, and from pestilence, that they may declare all their iniquities among the nations whither they go. And they shall know that I am the Lord.

17 Again a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, thou shalt eat thy bread with sorrow and drink water with tribulation and affliction, and thou shalt say respecting the
people of that land, Thus saith the Lord to the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel, They shall eat their loaves with scantiness, and drink water with astonishment, that the land may be wasted with the fulness thereof; for all its inhabitants are in a course of impiety; and their cities which are inhabited shall be laid waste and the land shall be a desolation and ye shall know that I am the Lord.

Again a word of the Lord came to me saying, Son of man,
what proverb is this which you have concerning Israel, saying, The days are far off. Vision is lost. Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord, I will change this parable; and the house of Israel shall no more use it; for thou shalt say to them, The days are at hand and the word of every vision. For there shall no more be a false vision of any sort, or a flattering diviner among the children of Israel; for I the Lord will speak my words—I will speak and perform, and no more put off to a distant time; for in these your days, O rebellious house, I will speak a word and perform it, saith the Lord.

Again a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, behold the house of Israel, that rebellious house, speak saying, The vision which this man seeth is for many days; and for times far distant he prophesieth; therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord, None of my words which I speak shall any more be prolonged. I will speak and I will perform saith the Lord.

VI. AGAIN a word of the Lord came to me saying,
Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel and thou shalt prophesy and say to them, Hear a word of the Lord, Thus saith the Lord, Woe to the prophets who prophesy from their own hearts and see nothing. Like foxes among ruins thy prophets, O Israel, stood not for strength. When flocks were collected against the house of Israel, they who say, "In the day of the Lord," stood not up. They are seers of lies they are prophesiers of vanities—they say, The Lord saith, Though the Lord did not send them: and in order to confirm a word they began with, "Have you not seen a false vision and spoken false prophesies," now therefore say, Thus saith the Lord, Because your words are false and your prophe-
sics vain; therefore behold I am against you, saith the Lord;
9 And I will stretch forth my hand against these prophets, who see falsehoods and prophesy vanities: they shall not be in the school of my people nor enrolled in the enrollment of the house of Israel; nor shall they enter into the land of Israel and they shall know that I am the Lord. Because they have led my people astray, saying "Peace" when there was no peace. And
11 when one buildeth a wall they anoint it; it shall fall. Say to these anointers, It shall fall. For there shall be an overwhelming rain, and I will send hail stones against their buttresses; and they shall fall; and a tempestuous wind; and it shall be broken down. Now when the wall is fallen, will they not say to you, "Where is the anointing with which you anointed it?"
13 Therefore thus saith the Lord, I will cause a furious tempest to break it down; and there shall be an overwhelming rain in mine anger; And I will bring the hail stones against it with fury for destruction; and demolish the wall which you anointed; and it shall fall: and lay it flat on the ground and its foundations shall be discovered; and when it shall fall, you shall be consumed with rebukes; and you shall know that I am the Lord.
15 When I accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on them who anoint it; it shall fall. I have indeed said to you, the wall is no more, nor do they exist who anointed it, namely, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem and who see peace for her when there is no peace, saith the Lord.
17 Now as for thee son of man set thy face also against the daughters of thy people who prophesy from their own heart; and prophesy against them and say,
18 Thus saith the Lord, Woe to those women who sew pillows under every elbow; and make coverings for every head of every age, to lead souls astray. The souls of my people have been turned out of the way. They have indeed inveigled souls and profaned me to my people, for a handful of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill souls which should not die; and to preserve souls alive which ought not to live, by your oracling
20 to the people who hearken to vain oracles. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Lord, Behold I am against your pillows on which you whirl souls about; and I will tear them from your arms and dismiss the souls—those souls which you are whirling about
21 for dispersion: and I will tear in pieces your coverings and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall no more be in your hands to be whirled about. And ye shall know that I am the Lord. Because you turned aside the heart of the righteous, whom I turned not aside, in order that you might strengthen the hands of a transgressor that he should by no means turn from his evil way and live; therefore you shall no more see falsities, nor shall you any more utter divinations; for I will deliver my people out of your hand and you shall know that I am the Lord.

XIV. VII. WHEN some of the elders, principal men of the people of Israel, had come to me and were sitting before me a word of the Lord came to me, saying,
3 Son of man, these men have given their imaginations the rule over their hearts, though they placed before their eyes the punishment of their transgressions. Shall I, being consulted, return them an answer? Therefore speak to them, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord, Be the man who he may of the house of Israel, who giveth his imagination the rule over his understanding, when he hath set before his eyes the punishment of his iniquity, and cometh to a prophet: I the Lord will answer him by the things with which his mind is entangled, that he may lead the house of Israel astray, according to their hearts which are alienated from me by their desires, Say therefore to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, Lord, reform and turn from your evil devices, and from all your acts of impiety; and turn your faces about. For be the man who he may of the house of Israel, or of the proselytes who have sojourned with Israel, who shall separate himself from me, and give his desires the rule over his understanding when he hath set before his eyes the punishment of his iniquity and shall come to the prophet that he may inquire of me; I the Lord will answer him by that with which he is entangled; and I will set my face against that man, and give him up to desolation and destruction; and remove him from among my people; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. And with respect to that prophet when he shall have wandered and spoken; I the Lord have caused that prophet to wander, and I will stretch out my
hand against him and destroy him from among my people Israel. And they shall bear their iniquity; the inquirer according to his guilt, and in like manner the prophet according to his guilt, that the house of Israel may no more be led astray from me, and that they may no more be polluted with their transgressions: so they shall be my people and I will be their God, saith the Lord.

Again a word of the Lord came to me saying, Son of man, when a country transgresseth against me, so as to incur ruin; and I stretch out my hand against it; and break the staff of bread, and send against it famine, and destroy out of it both man and beast; should there be in it three such men as these Noe, Daniel and Job: They for their righteousness shall be saved, saith the Lord. Or if I send wild beasts against that land and punish it, and it become a desolation not to be traveled by reason of the wild beasts; and there be in it three such as those; As I live, saith the Lord neither sons nor daughters shall be saved; none but they only shall escape, and the land shall be for destruction. Or if I bring a sword against that land, and say, sword, pass thou through this land, that I may cut off from it man and beast; should there be in it three such men as those; As I live saith the Lord, they shall not deliver sons nor daughters; they and they only shall be saved. Or if I send a pestilence against that land, and pour out my wrath upon it with slaughter, with intent to destroy out of it man and beast, and Noe, Daniel and Job be therein; As I live, saith the Lord, neither sons nor daughters shall be left: they for their righteousness shall deliver only their own souls. Yet thus saith the Lord, Though I send these my four severe judgments sword and famine and wild beasts and pestilence, against Jerusalem to destroy out of it man and beast, still, behold some are left in it, the saved of it, who are leading out of it sons and daughters; behold they are coming out to you and you shall see their ways and their desires, and be sorry for the evils which they have brought on Jerusalem—for all the evils which they have brought upon it. And they will comfort you, for you will see their ways and their desires; and you will know that I have not without cause done all those things which I have done to it, saith the Lord.
XV. VIII. AGAIN a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, Why should the wood of the grape vine be distinguished from the wood of all the branchy trees which are among the trees of the forest? Can men use the wood of it for any kind of workmanship? Can they make a pin of it to hang thereon any utensil? Is it not in a peculiar manner doomed to be consumed by fire? Every year the fire consumeth what is lopped from it. And if a bit of it is left, is it fit for any kind of workmanship? Even when entire it will be unfit for any work: how then, when fire hath burned it to a brand, can it serve for any work? Say therefore, Thus saith the Lord, Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have doomed to be destroyed by fire, so have I doomed the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will set my face against them. When they escape out of one fire another shall devour them. And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them. And I will make the land a desolation for their apostacy, saith the Lord.

XVI. Then a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, testify against Jerusalem her iniquities, and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord to Jerusalem, Thy root and thy pedigree is from the land of Chanaan. Thy father was an Amorite and thy mother a Chettite, and this is the history of thy birth—on the day thou wast born thy navel was not tied nor wert thou washed with water nor sprinkled with salt; nor wert thou wrapped up in swaddling bands. But mine eye which was over thee did not spare to do for thee all these things—to compassionate thee. When thou wast cast out into the open field for thine ill shape, on the day thou wast born; I passed by thee and saw thee polluted with thy blood and said to thee, From thy blood there is life. Be multiplied like the grass of the field; I have betrothed thee. So thou didst increase and grow great and enter the class of chief cities. Thy breasts were fashioned and thy locks flowing. But thou wast naked and exposed to shame. Then I passed by thee and beheld thee and lo! thou wast of a marriageable age. So I spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness; and sware to thee and entered into covenant with thee, saith the Lord. And when thou becamest mine I washed thee with water, and
cleansed away thy blood from thee and anointed thee with oil;
10 And I clothed thee with embroidery and shod thee with purple sandals and girded thee with a cotton zone and threw around thee a mantle of tissue. And I decked thee with ornaments, and put bracelets round thy wrists and a chain round thy neck, and gave thee a jewel for thy nose and ear-rings for thine ears, and a crown of exquisite beauty for thy head. So thou wast adorned with gold and silver, and thy raiment was of cotton, tissue and embroidery; and thy food was fine flour, oil and honey. And thou becamest exceeding beautiful, and thy fame spread among the nations for thy beauty. Because it was perfect by reason of the comeliness and the elegance with which I adorned thee, saith the Lord; thou wast vain of thy beauty and became a harlot because of thy renown: and didst pour out thy fornications upon every passenger. Nay thou didst take some of thy garments and make for thyself idols of needle work; and didst commit gross fornication on them. Though thou shouldst not have gone in; nor should such a thing be done, thou didst take the vessels, which were thy boast, made of my gold and of my silver, some of those which I gave thee; and didst make for thyself male images and commit fornication with them. Thou didst take also thine embroidered raiment and clothe them and didst set mine oil and mine incense before them. My bread also which I gave thee—the fine flour, oil and honey with which I fed thee, these thou didst set before them for a sweet smelling savour. Nay, it came to pass, saith the Lord, That thou didst take thy sons and thy daughters whom thou hadst born and didst sacrifice these to them to be devoured. As if it had been a small matter to commit fornication, thou didst slay thy children and offer them up, making them expiatory sacrifices to those images, (this exceeded all thy fornication) and didst not remember thy youth when thou wast naked and bare, when though polluted with thy blood thou didst live. Nay after all these acts of iniquity, saith the Lord, thou didst moreover build for thyself a brothel; and erect for thyself a place of prostitution in every street; at the head of every street thou didst build thy brothels, and sacrifice thy beauty and prostitute thyself to every comer, and multiply thine acts of whoredom. When thou hadst com-
mitted fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours and lustful paramours; and hadst done this frequently to provoke me to wrath, though I stretched forth my hand against thee, and deprived thee of thy dues and delivered thee up to them who hate thee—to the daughters of the Philistines, who turned thee out of that way in which thou wast committing iniquity; yet thou wentest a whoring among the daughters of Assur; and even thus wast not satisfied. So having committed whoredom and not being satiated thou didst multiply thy covenants with the land of the Chaldees and even with these thou wast not satisfied. How can I dispose of thy daughter? saith the Lord seeing thou hast committed all these acts of an abandoned woman? And hast trebled thy fornication by thy daughters? Having built a brothel at the head of every way, and erected a place of prostitution in every street, wast thou like a harlot collecting hire? Was there ever an adulterous woman like thee receiving gifts from her husband and giving rewards to her gallants? For thou hast given rewards to all thy lovers, and loaded them with gifts to come to thee from all around. So there was in thee a depravity beyond other women, both in thy whoredom and with regard to them who committed lewdness with thee. Thy giving gifts and no rewards being given thee are evidences of thy depravity. Therefore, hear O harlot, a word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast squandered thy money, therefore thy scandalous fornication shall be exposed before thy lovers; but for all thy wicked desires and for the blood of thy children whom thou hast sacrificed to them—for this behold I will assemble all thy lovers with whom thou hast had connexion, both all whom thou hast loved and all whom thou hatedst, and I will gather against thee them from all around; and lay open thy wickedness before them, that they may see all thy shame. And I will punish thee with the punishment of an adulteress, and involve thee in the blood of wrath and jealousy; and deliver thee up into their hands. And they shall demolish thy brothel, and pull down thy place of prostitution, and strip thee of thy clothing and seize thy fair jewels; and when they shall have left thee naked and exposed to shame, then crowds shall be brought against thee, who shall stone thee with stones and hack thee with their
41 swords; and they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute vengeance on thee in the sight of many women. So will I 42 turn thee from whoredom and no more give thee gifts. Then I will cause my wrath against thee to abate, and my jealousy shall be removed from thee, and I will be quiet and no more 43 care for thee. Because thou hast not remembered thy youth and hast grieved me with all these things; therefore behold I have requited thy ways on thy head, saith the Lord. Thou 44 indeed hast so added impiety to all thy transgressions that all these things have occasioned the parable which people use against thee, saying, "As was the mother so is the daughter." 45 Thou art indeed a very daughter of thy mother who abandoned her husband and her children: and the sisters of thy brothers are they who abandoned their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Chettite and your father an 46 Amorite, your eldest sister is Samaria—she and her daughters who live on thy left; and your youngest sister who liveth on 47 thy right is Sodom with her daughters. But thou hast not walked even in their ways, nor done according to their transgressions in a small degree. Thou hast surpassed them in all 48 thy ways. As I live, saith the Lord, Sodom herself and her daughters did not do as thou and thy daughters have done. 49 But this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom—Pride. Through fulness of bread and prosperity she and her daughters grew wanton. There was this also in her and her daughters that they did not assist the distressed and the needy; but were haughty and committed iniquities in my sight; therefore 51 I destroyed them. In my view Samaria also did not commit half thy crimes. Thou indeed hast multiplied thine iniquities more than they, and justified thy sisters by all thine iniquities which thou hast committed. Thou therefore shalt bear thy punishment. Inasmuch as thou hast corrupted thy sisters by thy sins, which thou hast committed in a more aggravated degree than they, and made them righteous in comparison of thee; be thou therefore confounded and bear thy dishonour, 53 for having justified thy sisters. When I turn back their apostacies—the apostacy of Sodom and her daughters, and turn back the apostacy of Samaria and her daughters, I will turn 54 back also thine apostacy in the midst of them; that thou mayst
bear thy punishment and be dishonoured for all that thou hast done to provoke me to anger. And when thy sister Sodom and her daughters shall be restored to their former state then thou and thy daughters shall be restored to your former state.

Now was not thy sister Sodom a by word in thy mouth in the days of thy pride, before thy wickedness was discovered; in the same manner as thou art now the scoff of the daughters of Syria and of all around her and of all the daughters of the foreign tribes around thee? Thou hast borne thy wickedness and thy transgressions, saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord, I will deal with thee as thou hast done. As thou hast slighted these things that thou mightest transgress my covenant, when I remember my covenant made with thee in the days of thy youth and re-establish for thee an everlasting covenant; then thou wilt recollect thy way and be ashamed, when thou hast again received thy sisters—the elder and the younger. For I will give them to thee to be part of thy family, but not by thy covenant. And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, that thou mayst remember and be ashamed, and never more be able to open thy mouth, because of thy confusion when I make a complete atonement for thee according to all that thou hast done, saith the Lord.

IX. AGAIN a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, relate a fable and speak a parable to the house of Israel and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, There was a great eagle with large wings, rapid in its motion and completely furnished with talons: and it winged its way to Libanus, and took hold of its choicest cedar; and cropped the tops of the tender branch and brought them to the land of Chanaan, and in a walled city they were deposited. Then he took a seedling of the land, and planted it in a field by much water, and ordered it to be taken care of. And it sprang up and became a vine weak and small, so that its branches could be seen only by them near it. But it had roots underneath it, so it grew to be a vine, and put forth shoots and extended its tendrils.

And there was another eagle with large wings and many
talons: and lo! this vine warped towards him, and its roots were towards him and it shot out its branches for him, that he might water it together with the shoot of its own planting, which being in a good soil by much water grew luxuriantly, so as to blossom and bear fruit, and become a great vine.—
9 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord, Shall it prosper? Shall not the roots of this tender shoot and its fruit be blasted? Yes; all its former shoots shall wither; so that it will not require a strong arm nor much people to pull it up by its roots. Though behold it is luxuriant, shall it prosper—shall it not wither at the first touch of a blasting wind? Both it and its sprouting shoot shall be withered.
11 Moreover a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man say now to this rebellious house, Do you not know the meaning of this? Say, When the king of Babylon hath come to Jerusalem, and shall take the king thereof and the chiefs thereof, and hath caused them to be brought to him to Babylon; and shall take one of the royal seed and make a covenant with him, and shall lay him under an oath and comprehend the generals of the land, that it shall be a weak kingdom and never be independent—that he will keep this covenant with him and that it shall stand. Now should he revolt from him so as to send his ambassadors to Egypt, that it may furnish him with horses and a great army, shall he prosper? Shall he who is perfidious escape? And shall he who breaketh a covenant be delivered? As I live saith the Lord, in the place where the king liveth, who made him king; even with him in Babylon shall he die who hath dishonoured my oath and broken my covenant: and neither with a great army nor with much people, shall Pharao support him in the war, when ramparts are a raising, and towers a building to destroy lives.—
18 As he hath dishonoured an oath, by breaking a covenant, (when lo! he had given his hand) and hath done all these things to him, he shall not escape. Therefore say, As I live saith the Lord, The oath which he hath dishonoured, and the covenant which he hath broken, even this I will requite upon his head. And I will spread my net for him and he shall be taken in my enclosure. In every engagement his men shall fall by the sword; and them who are left I will scatter to
every wind; and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken.

22 For thus saith the Lord,
    I will myself take one of the choicest cedars from a summit; (their hearts I will nip) and I will plant it on a lofty mountain; I will cause it to be suspended on a lofty mountain of Israel; and I will plant it, and it shall blossom and bear fruit, and become a great cedar; and under it shall rest every bird, even all the winged tribe shall repose in its shade: its branches shall be renewed: and all the trees of the plain shall know that I am the Lord who bringeth down the lofty tree, and exalteth the tree which is low, and who causeth the green tree to wither, and the withered tree to flourish. I the Lord have spoken and I will perform.

XVIII. X. AGAIN a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man why have you this proverb among the children of Israel, saying, "The fathers have eaten a sour grape and the children's teeth are set on edge." As I live saith the Lord, This parable shall no more be used by Israel, for all souls are mine. As the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine. The soul that sinneth it shall die. But the man who shall be just, who executeth judgment and justice, who eateth not upon the mountains, nor listeth up his eyes to the desires of the house of Israel, and defileth not his neighbour's wife, nor approacheth a woman in a state of separation; who shall oppress no man; shall restore the pledge of a debtor and not be guilty of rapine; who shall deal out his bread to the hungry, and clothe the naked, and not lend his money on interest, nor take usury, and shall turn away his hand from injustice, and execute righteous judgment between man and man, and hath walked in my statutes, and kept my judgments to do them. Such a one is righteous.—He shall live, saith the Lord.

10 But if he beget a profligate son, a shedder of blood and one who committeth sins, who hath not walked in the way of his righteous father but hath eaten on the mountains and defiled his neighbour's wife; hath oppressed the poor and needy, and been guilty of rapine; hath not restored a pledge and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols; hath done injustice, lent on in-
terest and taken usury. He shall not live. He hath committed all these iniquities. He shall surely die. His blood shall be upon him. But if he beget a son who hath seen all the sins which his father committed and hath been struck with awe and not done the like—hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor fixed his eyes on the desires of the house of Israel; nor defiled his neighbour's wife, nor oppressed any man, nor taken a pledge; nor been guilty of rapine—hath dealt out his bread to the hungry and clothed the naked, and turned away his hand from injustice; hath neither lent on interest nor taken usury; hath practised justice and walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquities of his father. He shall live. But as for his father, if he be guilty of rapine and oppression, he hath done wrong in the midst of my people, and for his iniquities he shall die. Now should you say, Why hath not the son borne the iniquity of his father? Because the son hath practised justice and mercy; hath kept all my statutes and done them, he shall live. But the soul which sinneth shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of his father; nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and upon the iniquitous shall be his iniquity. But if the unrighteous man will turn from all the unrighteous acts which he hath done, and will keep all my commandments, and practise righteousness and mercy; he shall surely live and not die. None of the transgressions which he committed shall be remembered; for the righteousness which he hath exercised, he shall live. Can I (saith the Lord) so much desire the death of the unrighteous, as I do that he should turn from his evil way and live? But when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity according to all the iniquities which the wicked hath done, none of the righteous acts which he hath done shall be remembered. For the sins which he hath committed, even for these he shall die. Yet you have said, The way of the Lord is not straight. Hear now, all ye house of Israel, Is not my way straight? Is it not your way which is not straight? When the righteous turneth from his righteousness and committeth a crime, for the crime he committeth he should die—for it he shall die. And when a wicked man turneth from his wickedness which he committed, and shall practise justice and righteous-
ness; he hath saved his soul. He hath turned away from all his wicked acts which he committed; he shall surely live; he shall not die. Yet the house of Israel say, The way of the Lord is not straight. Is not my way straight, O house of Israel? Is it not your way which is not straight? I will judge you, saith the Lord, O house of Israel, every one according to his way. Be converted and turn from all your acts of wickedness, and they shall not bring upon you the punishment of iniquity. Cast away from you all your impious acts; which you have impiously committed against me; and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: now why do you die, O house of Israel, since I desire not the death of him who dieth? saith the Lord.

XIX. Now take thou up a lamentation for the prince of Israel and thou shalt say, What was thy mother? She was a lioness among lions. In the midst of lions she multiplied her young. And one of her young lions sallied forth; he became a lion and learned to prowl. He devoured men and the nations heard of him; in their trap he was taken and carried in a cage to the land of Egypt. When she saw that her main support was removed from her, was lost; she took another of her young lions and made him lion. And he roamed about among lions. He became a lion and learned to seize prey. He devoured men and prowled with fierceness, and made their cities a desolation and laid waste the land, and the fulness thereof by the sound of his roaring. Then the nations set upon him from the countries around: they spread their nets for him; in their trap he was taken. So they chained him and in a cage he came to the king of Babylon, who put him in prison that his voice should not be heard on the mountains of Israel. Thy mother was like a vine or a flowery pomegranate planted by water. It was fruitful and full of buds by being plentifully watered. And it became a sceptre for them who bear rule over tribes, and became distinguished for its greatness among other stocks, and was conscious of its greatness by the multitude of its branches. But it is broken in wrath and thrown on the ground; and a burning wind hath blasted its choice branches. Vengeance hath been taken on them: and the rod of its strength is withered; a fire hath consumed it. And now when they had planted it in a desert, in a land without water, a fire hath issued forth from a rod of her choice shoots, and consumed her and she hath no
more in her a sceptre of power. The tribe is become a parable in the song of woe and shall be for a subject of lamentation.

XX. X. AND it came to pass in the seventh year, on the fifth month and tenth day of the month, that some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord, and while they were sitting before me a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man speak to the elders of the house of Israel and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord, Are you come to inquire of me? As I live, saith the Lord, I will not answer you; I will not, son of man, with avengement avenge them. Testify against them the iniquities of their fathers and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord, from the day I chose the house of Israel; and was made known to the seed of the house of Jacob; and acknowledged by them in the land of Egypt; when I took hold of them with my hand, saying, I the Lord am your God,—on the very day when I took hold of them with my hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt into the land which I had prepared for them—a land flowing with milk and honey—it is the honeycomb of the whole earth; though I said to them let every one put away the abominations of his eyes and with the devices of Egypt be not polluted, I the Lord am your God; yet they apostatized from me and would not hearken to me. They did not cast away the abominations of their eyes, nor did they utterly forsake the devices of Egypt; therefore I spoke of pouring out my wrath on them—of spending mine indignation on them in the midst of Egypt: but that my name might not be altogether profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they were, I did in their sight [those miracles] by which I was made known to them, in order to bring them out of the land of Egypt.

So I led them into the wilderness; and gave them my statutes and made known to them my rules of rectitude, which if a man practise he shall live thereby; I gave them also my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them; that they might know that I the Lord am their sanctifier. And I said to the house of Israel in the wilderness, "Walk in my statutes," but they walked not. They rejected my rules of rectitude, which if a man practise he shall live by them; and they profaned my
sabbaths exceedingly: whereupon I spoke of pouring out my wrath on them in the wilderness, to destroy them utterly:
14 But I acted so that my name should not be altogether profaned in the sight of the nations, before whose eyes I had brought them
15 out: and I lifted up my hand against them in the wilderness thus far—that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, (a land flowing with milk and honey: it is the honeycomb of the whole earth) because they had rejected my rules of rectitude, and had not walked in my statutes; but profaned my sabbaths, and had gone after the desires of their own heart. But mine eye had compassion on them so as not to blot them out entirely; so I did not bring them to utter destruction in the wilderness.
18 Then I said to their children in the wilderness, walk not ye in the customs of your fathers, nor observe their rules of conduct; have no communication with their devices and be not polluted. I the Lord am your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my rules of rectitude and practise them; and hallow my sabbaths and let them be a sign between me and you, that you acknowledge that I the Lord am your God. But even these their children rebelled against me. In my statutes they did not walk, nor did they keep my rules of rectitude to practise them, which if a man do he shall live by them; and they profaned my sabbaths; therefore I spoke of pouring out my wrath upon them in the wilderness—of accomplishing mine indignation upon them. But I acted so that my name should not be utterly profaned in the sight of the nations. As I had brought them out before their eyes, I lifted up my hand against them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries. Because they did not practise my rules of rectitude, but rejected my statutes and profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after the desires of their fathers; therefore I gave them statutes not morally good, and rules of conduct in which they could not entitle themselves to life by them, that I might by their own doctrinal notions pollute them, when I passed through all their first born males in order to remove them out of sight. Therefore, speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord, thus far your fathers provoked me to
wrath, by their transgressions which they committed against me. And when I brought them into the land, which I lifted up my hand to give them; they beheld every high hill and every shady grove, and there they sacrificed to their gods; and there set in order the sweet smelling savour; and there poured out their libations. And when I said to them, What is this Abama, that you go thither, they called its name Abama, which it retaineth to this day. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord if you are polluted with the iniquities of your fathers and you go a whoring after their abominations even with the first fruits of your gifts—with those dedications, with which you are polluted by all your desires even to this day, shall I return you an answer, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord, I will not answer you. And though this should come into your mind it shall not be as you say, "We will be like the nations and like the tribes of the earth in worshipping stocks and stones." For as I live, saith the Lord, With a strong hand and an uplifted arm, and with an out poured wrath I will reign over you. And I will bring you out from among the peoples and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered with a strong hand and an uplifted arm and with out poured wrath. And I will bring you into the wilderness of the tribes and there plead with you face to face. As I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord. And I will make you pass under my rod and bring you in by number, and select from among you the wicked and the apostates; (for out of their captivity I will bring even these, but into the land of Israel they shall not come) and you shall know that I am the Lord, Lord.

Now as for you, O house of Israel; Thus saith the Lord, put away every one his devices, and after that if you will hearken to me, and no more profane my holy name with your gifts and your devices, (for on my holy mountain, on my lofty mountain, saith the Lord, there all the house of Israel shall serve me at last; and there I will expect and there I will accept your offerings—even the offerings of your dedications at all your solemnities) with the odour of sweet smelling incense I will accept you, when I have brought you out from among the
peoples, and received you from the countries in which you have been dispersed, and I will be hallowed among you before the eyes of the peoples, and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have brought you to the land of Israel, to the land for which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers; and you will there remember your ways and your devices with which you have been polluted, and express contrition for all your acts of wickedness: and acknowledge that I am the Lord, when I deal thus with you (that my name may not be profaned) according to your evil ways and according to your corrupt devices, saith the Lord.

Then a word of the Lord came to me, saying, son of man, set thy face against Thaiman and look towards Daram and prophesy against the forest at the head of Nageb, and thou shalt say to the forest of Nageb, hear a word of the Lord, Thus saith the Lord, Lord, behold I am kindling a fire in thee, and it shall devour in thee every green tree and every dry tree; and the flame which is kindled shall not be extinguished; and by it the whole surface from south to north shall be burned up.

And all flesh shall know that I the Lord have kindled it. It shall not be extinguished.

And when I said, "O Lord, Lord, forbid" they said to me, Is not this a parable which is spoken? Whereupon a word of the Lord came to me saying, Therefore prophesy, son of man, set thy face against Jerusalem, and look towards their holy things, and thou shalt prophesy against the land of Israel and thou shalt say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, behold I am against thee and I will draw my sword out of its sheath, and root out of thee the lawless and unjust. Because I will root out of thee the lawless and unjust; therefore my sword shall come forth out of its sheath against all flesh from south to north. And all flesh shall know, that I the Lord have drawn my sword out of its sheath. It shall not return any more. Therefore, son of man, heave thou convulsive groans, and sigh sorrowfully before their eyes. And if they say to thee, Why art thou groaning? Then thou shalt say, Because of the news: for it is coming: and every heart shall be broken, and all hands enfeebled; and all flesh and every spirit shall faint; and all thighs shall be polluted with filth. Behold it is coming! saith the Lord."
8 Then a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, prophesy and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, Say,
9 O sword, sword be sharp, and full of fury that thou mayst slaughter; be sharpened that thou mayst glisten; being prepared for destruction slay; set at naught; fell every tree. He hath now made it ready for his hand to grasp it. The sword is sharpened. It is ready to be put into the hand of the slayer.
12 Scream, son of man, and raise the mournful cry; for it is come among my people; it is among all the leaders of Israel. They shall dwell near the sword. It is among my people. Therefore give it a clap of applause with thy hand.
13 (p) Because its cause is just, what then? Must the tribe be cast off?
14 (J) That shall not be the case saith the Lord, Lord. But, thou son of man, prophesy and clap thy hands and redouble the sword. It is the third sword of the slain, the great sword of slaughter. Therefore thou shalt strike them with terror.
15 See that thy heart be not broken, though the fainty be multiplied at every gate. They are delivered up to the slaughter of the sword. It is well made for slaughter. It is well made to glitter. Therefore pass through. Be sharp on the right and on the left; which way soever thy face may be raised up. And as for me I will clap my hands and give a loose to my wrath. I the Lord have spoken.
18 Then a word of the Lord came to me, saying, And thou son of man, Sketch out for thyself two ways, for the sword of the king of Babylon to enter. From one and the same country let them both come; and let there be a hand at the head of the way to the city. At the head of that way thou shalt set it up, for the sword to enter against Rabbath of the Ammonites, and against Judea and against Jerusalem in the midst of it.
21 For the king of Babylon will halt on the old road—at the head of the two roads to consult an oracle, to divine with an arrow and inquire by graven images and inspect a liver. The oracle against Jerusalem is favourable, to throw up a rampart, to open his mouth with a war cry; to raise his voice with shout-

(p) The prophet. (J) Jehovah.
ing, to cast up a rampart against her gates to raise a mount and build towers for his engines. Now while this man is to them as one consulting an oracle, that other is causing his usurpation to be remembered.

24 Therefore thus saith the Lord, Because you have brought your iniquities into remembrance by disclosing your impieties; that your sins may be seen, by all your acts of impiety and by your devices—because you have brought them into remembrance, for them you shall be taken. And as for thee, thou profane wicked ruler of Israel, whose day is coming at the appointed season, there is an end to thy usurpation. Thus saith the Lord, Thou hast pulled off the coronet, and put on the imperial diadem. It shall not be such. Thou hast debased what was high and exalted what was low. To usurpation, usurpation, usurpation I will expose it; alas for it! Such it shall be till He come, to whom it of right belongeth; and I will give it to him.

28 Now as for thee, son of man, prophesy and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, with regard to the Ammonites and their reproach even thus thou shalt say, O sword, sword, drawn for slaughter, and drawn for destruction, be lifted up that thou mayst glisten. By the vain vision and false prophesying concerning thee, the day came at the appointed season, for turning thee on the necks of wounded transgressors. There is an end of usurpation; turn back; tarry not. In the place where thou wast born, in thine own land I will judge thee. And I will pour out my wrath upon thee; and with the fire of mine indignation blow upon thee, and deliver thee into the hands of barbarous men skilled in destruction. Thou shalt be fuel for fire and thy blood shall be in the midst of thy land. There shall no more be any remembrance of thee. I the Lord have spoken.

XXII. Then a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Now, son of man, if thou will judge this bloody city, then point out to it all its iniquities and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, Lord, O city, which sheddest blood in the midst of thee, to cause thy time to come; and which makest idols against thyself to pollute thyself. In the blood which thou hast shed, thou art fallen: and with thine idols, which thou hast made, thou art defiled: and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and hast brought on the term of thy years; therefore I have made
thee a scoff to the nations, and a mocking stock to all the countries—to those near and to those far from thee; and they shall insult thee, thou impure, infamous and abandoned city. Behold in thee the princes of the house of Israel banded themselves, every one with his relations, that they might shed blood. In thee they reviled father and mother; and in thee practised injustice against the stranger. They oppressed the widow and the orphan; and in thee they despised my holy things and profaned my sabbaths. In thee men became robbers, that in thee they might shed blood. And they ate upon the mountains near thee; and in the midst of thee committed abominable things. In thee they uncovered the nakedness of a father; and in thee humbled a woman in a state of separation. In thee one debauched his neighbour's wife; another wantonly defiled his daughter in law; and another humbled his sister, his father's daughter. In thee they received bribes to shed blood. In thee they took interest and usury, and thou hast completed thy wickedness by oppression. And me thou hast forgotten, saith the Lord. Now when I lay my hand on thee to destroy thee, for what thou hast done and for the blood which hath been shed in thee; will thy heart endure? Will thy hands be strong in the day I deal with thee? I the Lord have spoken and I will perform. I will scatter thee among the nations and disperse thee through the countries, and when thine impurity shall be consumed out of thee, I will take possession of thee in the sight of all the nations; and you shall know that I am the Lord. Again a word of the Lord came to me, saying, son of man, Behold to me the house of Israel are all become mixed with brass and iron and tin and lead with a mixture of silver. Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord, Lord, Because you are become one mass, I will therefore gather you into the midst of Jerusalem: as silver and brass and iron and tin and lead are put in a furnace, that the fire may be blown on it and that it may be melted; So will I take you in my wrath and gather you and melt you. And I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath and you shall be melted in the midst of it. As silver is melted in the midst of a furnace; so shall you be melted in the midst of it; and you shall know that I the Lord have poured out my wrath on you.
Again a word of the Lord came to me, saying; Son of man say to this land, Thou art a land which was not watered with showers; nor did rain fall upon thee in the day of indignation. Its princes in the midst of it were like roaring lions, ravening prey, devouring souls by oppression, yet receiving honours; and thy widows were multiplied in the midst of thee.

Its priests also despised my law and profaned my holy things; between what was holy and what was profane they made no difference, nor did they distinguish between the unclean and the clean. And from my sabbaths they hid their eyes and I was profaned in the midst of them. Its chiefs in the midst of it were like wolves, ravening prey, to the shedding of innocent blood, that they may glut their greediness. They shall fall together with its prophets who anointed them, seeing vanities, prophesying lies, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Though the Lord did not speak, crushing by usurped authority the people of the land, and ravening prey, oppressing the poor and needy, and paying no regard to strangers to the administration of justice. Though I sought among them for a man of integrity and for one who stood uprightly before me in the time of indignation that I might utterly destroy it, yet I found none: therefore I poured out my wrath upon it, to destroy it utterly with the fire of mine indignation. Their ways I have requited on their heads, saith the Lord, Lord.

Again a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother, who in their youth had committed whoredom in Egypt. There they were first deflowered. And these were their names—the eldest was called Oola and her sister, Ooliba. And when they became mine and had borne me sons and daughters, These were their names—Oola was called Samaria, and Ooliba, Jerusalem. And Oola wantonly left me and attached herself to her lovers—to the Assyrians her neighbours, whose generals and leaders were clothed in blue. And the chosen youth were all horsemen, mounted on horses. But though she indulged her wantonness with them, who were all the principal men of the Assyrians, and with all them to whom she attached herself; and defiled herself with all their idols; yet she did not forsake her fornication with Egypt because they had
9 lain with her in her youth and first deflowered her. Wherefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians to whom she had attached herself. These exposed her shame. They took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword, and she became a common talk for women, and by her they gave warning to their daughters.

11 Though her sister Ooliba saw this, yet she became abandoned and more inordinate in her fornication than her sister. To the sons of the Assyrians she attached herself—to the rulers and generals near her who were arrayed in sumptuous apparel, who were horsemen mounted on horses. They were all chosen youths. When I saw that they were polluted; and that both took the same course; and that this one was adding to her fornication; for upon seeing men pourtrayed on the wall, the pictures of the Chaldeans drawn to the life with a pencil, having their loins girded with embroidered girdles, and deep dyed turbans on their heads; the majestic countenance of all resembling that of the Chaldees of the land of her nativity; she became attached to them by the sight of her eyes, and sent messengers to them to the land of Chaldea. And the sons of Babylon came to her, lay with her, and polluted her in whoredom. And when she was polluted by them, though her mind was alienated from them, still she discovered her whoredom and exposed her shame. So my mind became alienated from her as it had been from her sister. As thou hast multiplied thy whoredom, to call into remembrance the days of thy youth, in which thou didst play the harlot in Egypt, and though connected with the Chaldeans, men of beastly lust, hast looked back to the transgressions of thy youth—to what thou didst in the stew of Egypt where thou wast first deflowered. Therefore O Ooliba, thus saith the Lord, Behold I will raise up against thee thy lovers from whom thy mind is alienated; and I will bring them against thee on every side—the children of Babylon, even all the Chaldeans, Phakuk and Soue and Uchoue and all the Assyrians with them, chosen youths, leaders and generals, all men of high rank and renown, mounted on horses. And they shall come against thee from the north with chariots and wheeled carriages, and a multitude of peoples with bucklers and shields. And when a guard is set on thee
round about, I will give judgment before them and they shall punish thee by their judgments. And I will give a loose to my jealousy; and they shall deal with thee with furious wrath, they shall cut off thy nose and thine ears; and the remains of thee they shall hack with a sword. They shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and a fire shall devour the residue of thee.

And they shall strip thee of thy raiment, and take those jewels which are thy boast. And I will remove thine impieties which spring from thyself, and thy fornication which sprang from the land of Egypt; and thou shalt never lift up thine eyes to them, nor shalt thou any more remember Egypt. For thus saith the Lord, Lord, Behold I deliver thee into the hands of them whom thou hatest, and from whom thy mind is withdrawn; and they shall deal spitefully with thee, and take all those things for which thou hast laboured and toiled: and thou shalt be naked and in disgrace and the shame of thy whoredom shall be made public. Thine impiety and thy whoredom have brought these things on thee. By thy going a whoring after the nations, thou hast polluted thyself with their inordinate lusts. Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore I will put her cup into thy hands.

Thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt drink the cup of thy sister, which is deep, and which is large, and which is foaming over, to cause complete intoxication, that thou mayst be filled with fainting—even that cup of astonishment, the cup of thy sister Samaria. Let her take this: and I will turn away her festivals and her new moons; for I the Lord have spoken, saith the Lord.

Therefore thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast forgotten and cast me behind thee, take thou the effects of thine impiety and of thy whoredom.

Again the Lord said to me, Son of man, wilt thou not arraign Oola and Ooliba, and announce to them their iniquities? That they have committed adultery and there is blood on their hands? They have committed adultery with their idols; and caused their children whom they bore to me to pass through fire for them. And when they had done this to me, they polluted my holy things and profaned my sabbaths; for
when they had slaughtered their children to their idols, they went into my sanctuary to profane it.

40 Now because they have acted thus in my house; and because, for the men who came from afar, to whom messengers had been despatched, thou didst immediately on their coming, anoint thyself with oil and paint thine eyes with stibium, and adorn thyself with sumptuous attire, and sit on a covered sopha with a table set before it; and they were regaled with mine incense and mine oil, and joined in the harmonious song, even with men of the common herd who had come from the wilderness; (though they had put bracelets on their hands and a crown of exquisite beauty on their heads; I said, surely they do not commit adultery with these! But she acted the harlot and they went in unto her: in the same manner as they go in to a common woman, so did they go in unto Oola and to Ooliba to commit iniquity) therefore these are righteous men and they will punish them with the punishment of an adulteress and with the punishment for blood. Because they are adulteresses and there is blood on their hands, thus saith the Lord, Lord, Bring up a multitude against them and expose them to tumult and rapine; and stone them with the stones of tumultuous crowds; and stab them with their swords. Let their sons and their daughters be slain and their houses burned with fire, that I may remove impiety out of the land and that all women may take warning, and not commit the impieties which these have done. Thus shall your impiety be recompensed on you; and for your sins you shall receive retribution; and you shall know that I am the Lord.

XXIV. XII. AGAIN in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, a word of the Lord came to me, saying,

2 Son of man write down for thyself for a day, from this day on which the king of Babylon hath determinately set himself against Jerusalem; even from this very day; and speak a parable against that provoking family, and thou shalt say to them,
4 Thus saith the Lord, Set on the cauldron and pour water into it; and throw into it the pieces of meat, every choice piece, the flesh of the thigh and the shoulder separated from the
5 bones, and these of the choicest cattle; and burn the bones under them. It hath boiled and the bones have been sodden in it. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Ah! bloody city! a kettle, in which there is verdigrease in its very substance, and that verdigrease is not gone out of it. She hath brought it out on every member of her: no lot fell upon her. Because her blood is in the midst of her; I have ordered it to be poured out on a smooth stone: I have not poured it on the ground for the earth to cover it. That wrath may be kindled and vengeance executed, I have ordered the blood to be poured out on a smooth stone, that it may not be concealed.

9 Therefore thus saith the Lord, I will enlarge the pile, and heap on wood and cause the fire to burn, that the flesh may be consumed and the broth evaporated: and it shall stand on the coals that the brass may be heated red hot and melted in the midst of its impurity and its verdigrease quite destroyed; so that this its abundant verdigrease may not proceed from it. Its verdigrease shall be exposed to shame. Because thou wast polluted what else could be done, since thou wouldst not be cleansed till I filled up my wrath? I the Lord have spoken. He shall come: and I will act. I will not defer; nor will I shew compassion. According to thy ways and according to thy lusts I will judge thee, saith the Lord, therefore I will judge thee according to thy blood guiltiness; and I will judge thee according to thine inordinate lusts, O corrupt, infamous and very provoking city.

15 Then a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, Behold I take from thee the desires of thine eyes with a stroke. Thou must not mourn, nor utter lamentation. Let sighing for blood and grief of loins be suppressed. Thy hair shall be platted on thy head and thy sandals shall be on thy feet. Thou must not receive comfort from their lips, nor eat funeral bread.

18 So I spoke to the people in the morning as he had ordered me in the evening. And when I did in the morning as I was commanded, the people said to me, Why dost thou not tell us what these things mean which thou art doing? Thereupon I said to them, A word of the Lord came to me, saying, Say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, Behold
I will profane my sanctuary, the boast of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and for which your souls are moved with compassion; and your sons and your daughters whom you left shall fall by the sword: and you shall do as I have done. You shall not receive comfort from their mouth nor eat funeral bread; your locks of hair shall be on your head, and your sandals on your feet; you shall neither utter lamentations nor shed tears; but shall pine away for your iniquities and exhort one another. And Ezekiel shall be for a sign to you, (according to all that he hath done you shall do when these things happen) and you shall know that I am the Lord. And with regard to thee son of man, will not this be the case? On the day when I take from them their strength—that which was their exultation and boast and the desire of their eyes and the pride of their soul—their sons and their daughters; on that day one who escapeth shall come to thee to tell thee the news; on that day thy mouth shall be opened to him who escapeth. Thou shalt speak and no more be dumb and thou shalt be a sign to them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.

Again a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, set thy face against the children of Ammon and prophesy against them and thou shalt say to the children of Ammon, Hear a word of the Lord, Thus saith the Lord, Because you exulted over my sanctuary; because it was profaned and over the land of Israel because it was laid waste, and over the house of Juda, because they went into captivity; therefore behold I deliver you to the children of Kedem for a possession; and in their excursions they shall inhabit thee and pitch their tents in thee. They shall eat thy fruits and drink thy liquors. And I will make the city of Ammon feeding places for camels; and the land of the Ammonites a pasture for sheep; and you shall know that I am the Lord. For thus saith the Lord, Because thou didst clap thy hands and stamp with thy feet, and exult in thy soul over the land of Israel; therefore I will stretch forth my hand against thee, and deliver thee up for a spoil to the nations: and I will utterly destroy thee from among the peoples, and cause thee to perish out of the countries, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
8 Thus saith the Lord, Because Moab said, Behold! shall not the house of Israel and Juda be like all the nations?
9 Therefore behold I will loosen the shoulder of Moab from his frontier cities, that beautiful country the house of Bethasimoth, at the head of the fountain of the city on the sea shore. I have set the children of Kedem over the Ammonites, I have given them to him for an inheritance, that there may be
10 no remembrance of the Ammonites, and upon Moab I will execute vengeance; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
12 Thus saith the Lord, Because Idumea in executing vengeance on the house of Juda gratified private resentment and executed the sentence with rigour. Therefore thus saith the Lord, I will also stretch forth my hand against Idumea, and destroy out of it man and beast and make it a desolation. And they who are driven out of Thaiman shall fall by the sword.
14 And I will execute vengeance on Idumea by the hand of my people Israel who shall deal with Idumea according to mine indignation, and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance saith the Lord.
15 For the same cause, thus saith the Lord, Because the Philistines acted with revenge and with joy of heart heightened the punishment to destroy utterly; therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I will stretch forth my hand against the Philistines, and utterly exterminate the Cretans, and destroy the remnants which inhabit the sea coast, and inflict on them great punishments; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I execute my vengeance on them.

XXVI. XIII. AGAIN it came to pass in the eleventh year on the first of the month, a word of the Lord came to me, saying,
2 Son of man, Because Sor hath said against Jerusalem, Aha! She is trodden down; the nations have destroyed her; she is turned over to me; she that was full is laid waste,
3 therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I am against thee, Sor, and I will bring up many nations against thee, as the sea cometh up with its waves. And they shall demolish the walls of Sor and break down thy towers; and I will brush away the loose earth from it and make it a bare rock. It shall be a place to dry nets in the midst of the sea. As I have spoken, saith
6 the Lord, It shall indeed be a prey for the nations; and its daughters on the continent shall be slain with the sword: and
7 they shall know that I am the Lord. For thus saith the Lord, Behold against thee, Sor, I will bring from the North, Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon, a king of kings, with horses and chariots and horsemen, and a great assembly of many nations.
8 Thy daughters on the main land he will slay with the sword; and he will lay siege to thee and surround thee with works, and make a rampart against thee round about, with places for
9 engines; and arrange his lances over against thee, and with his
10 battle axes demolish thy walls and thy towers. By reason of the multitude of his horses their dust shall cover thee; and with the neighing of his horses and the rumbling of his chariot wheels thy walls shall shake when he entereth thy gates
11 like one entering a city from the plain. With the hoofs of his horses all thy streets shall be trampled. He will slay thy people with the sword; and level to the ground the confidence of
12 thy strength; and make a prey of thine army, and a spoil of thy wealth; and break down thy walls and demolish thy lovely houses; and thy stones and thy timbers and thy rubbish he
13 will throw into the midst of the sea. And he will put an end to the multitude of thy musicians; and the sound of thy
14 psalteries shall no more be heard. I will indeed make thee a bare rock. Thou shalt be a place for drying nets, thou shalt never be rebuilded any more; for I the Lord have spoken, saith the Lord.
15 For thus saith the Lord, Lord, to Sor: At the sound of thy fall; at the groans of thy wounded, when the sword is drawn in
16 the midst of thee, shall not the islands quake? Yes, from their thrones will come down all the chiefs of the maritime nations, and they will take their crowns from their heads, and strip off their embroidered robes. They will be struck with consternation and sit on the ground, and be in dread of their own de-
17 struction and groan for thee. And they will take up a lamentation for thee and say to thee, "How art thou destroyed from the sea, O renowned city! which didst impress the terror of
18 thee on all who inhabit its shores! The isles also will be terri-
19 fied at the day of thy fall. For thus saith the Lord, Lord, When I make thee a desolate city, like cities never to be rebuilded,
when I bring up the abyss against thee; much water shall cover thee. And I will press thee down to them who go down to the pit, to the people of old; and make thee dwell in the depths of the earth—in an everlasting desert, with them who go down to the pit; that thou mayst never be rebuilt nor rise again in the land of life. I will make thee a desolation; and thou shalt never come into existence again, saith the Lord, Lord.

XXVII. Then a word of the Lord came to me saying, Therefore, son of man, take up a lamentation for Sor and thou shalt say to Sor, which is situate at the entrance of the sea, the mart of nations from many isles, thus saith the Lord to Sor, thou saidst, "I have clothed myself with beauty." In the heart of the sea thy sons clothed thee with beauty for Beelim. The cedars from Senir cut into planks have been built into ships for thee; they took cypresses from Lebanon to make for thee tapering masts: from the groves of Bashan they made thy oars. Thy temples they built of ivory and thy roomy houses from the isles of the Chetians: cotton with embroidery from Egypt was the covering of thy bed. To add to thy glory, and that thou mightest clothe thyself with blue and purple, thy clothing came from the isles of Elisa. The inhabitants of Sidon were thy captains; and the Aradians were thy mariners; thine own wise men, Sor, who were in thee, were thy pilots. The elders of Biblii, even their wise men who were in thee, invigorated thy counsel. And all the ships of the sea and all the mariners of the western world were in thy service. Persians and Lydians and Libyans were in thine army. Thy warriors hung up in thee shields and helmets. They increased thy glory. The Aradians, the army on thy walls, were guards in thy towers; they hung up their quivers on thy shoulders round about. They made thy beauty perfect. The Karchadians purchased of thee for exportation, from thy vast stock of all kinds of merchandise; and paid thee for their purchases silver and gold and iron and tin and lead. Hellas, even that whole country and those stretching beyond it, traded with thee in the souls of men and supplied thy market with vessels of brass. From the house of Thegarma thy market was supplied with horses and horsemen. The sons of the Rhodians were thy merchants: from the isles they plentifully supplied thy market with ivory; and in exchange
16 thou didst supply them with thy merchandise, with slaves a part of thy exports from thy vast stock of wares, with stacte
17 and embroideries from Tharsis and Ramoth and Chorchor. Juda also and the children of Israel traded with thee in the sale of wheat and myrrh and cassia; and for thy merchandises supplied thee chiefly with honey and oil and frankincense. Damascus was thy customer for thine abundant wares of all kinds, they had wine from Chelbon, so they paid for their purchases
19 with wool from Miletus and with wine. From Asel thou wast supplied with manufactured iron, which was a part of thy merchandise by a circuitous trade. Daidan was a dealer with thee
21 and supplied thee with choice cattle for carriages. Arabia and all the chiefs of Kedar dealt with thee, and paid thee camels
22 and lambs and rams for what they purchased of thee. The merchants of Saba and Ramma traded with thee with the choicest spiceries and precious stones; they gave gold also for thy merchandise. Charra and Chana also were thy customers and so
24 were Assur and Charman: they supplied thy market with blue cloth and choice merchandise bound up in bales. Fleets of cypress ships were employed in thy trade. So with this multitude and with thy merchandise thou wast filled and deeply laden in the heart of the sea. Into deep water thy mariners steered thee. In the midst of the sea the south wind hath
27 wrecked thee. Thine armies, and the gains of thee and of thy factors, with thy mariners, and thy pilots, and thy counsellors, and thy factors and all thy warriors were on board of thee: and all this assemblage of thine which are in thee shall
28 sink in the heart of the sea on the day of thy ruin. At the scream
29 of thy voice thy pilots will be astounded. They who handle the oar and they on board ships will quit their vessels; and
30 they who frequent the sea will stand on the land, and with their voice raise a mournful cry for thee, and scream bitterly and put earth on their heads and strew themselves with ashes,
32 and their children will take up a lamentation for thee a peculiar song of woe for Sor—"what immense wealth didst thou acquire from the sea! with thine abundance thou didst fill nations; and
34 with thy traffic enrich all the kings of the earth. Now thou art overwhelmed in the sea; in deep water, thy merchandise, with
35 all thy crew in thee. All thy mariners are fallen. For thee all
the inhabitants of the isles are in distress, and their kings are struck with amaze, and tears bedew their countenance. For thee the merchants of the nations express pity; thou art utterly destroyed and never to be any more."

XXVIII. Again a word of the Lord came to me, saying, and thou son of man say to the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord, Because thy heart is elated, and thou hast said, "I am a God." "I inhabit the dwelling of a god in the heart of the sea." Now as for thee thou art a man and not a God; though thou hast set thy heart as the heart of a God. Art thou wiser than Daniel? Have not wise men taught thee with their knowledge? Didst thou by thy knowledge, or thine own understanding, procure for thyself power and gold and silver in thy treasuries? By thy great skill and thy traffic thou hast increased thy wealth; and with thy wealth thy heart is elated; therefore, Thus saith the Lord, Since thou hast set thy heart as the heart of a God; for this, behold I will bring against thee strange ravagers from the nations, and they shall unsheathe their swords against thee and against the beauty of thy wisdom; and they shall bring down thy beauty to destruction and trample thee down; and thou shalt die the death of wounded men in the heart of the sea.

Wilt thou say, "I am a God," in the presence of them who are slaying thee? Thou indeed art but a man and not a God. Among a multitude of uncircumcised thou shalt die by the hand of strangers, for I have spoken, saith the Lord.

Then a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, take up a lamentation for the prince of Tyre and say to him, Thus saith the Lord, Lord, thou wast an impression of resemblance and a crown of beauty. In the delightful paradise of God thou wast born. Thou hast been adorned with every precious stone, the sardis and topaz and emerald and carbuncle and sapphire and jasper, and with silver and gold and the ligure and agate, and amethyst and chrysolite and beryl and onyx; and hast filled thy treasuries and thy stores with gold.

From the day thou wast created thou wast with the cherub. On the holy mountain of God I placed thee, thou wast born in the midst of sparkling stones. Thou in thy days wast spotless from the day thou wast created, until iniquities were found in thee. By reason of thine abundant traffic thou didst fill thy
stores with iniquity and commit sins; therefore thou art cast out slain from the mountain of God; and from amidst the sparkling stones the cherub hath dragged thee. Thy heart was elated because of thy beauty; with thy beauty thine understanding was perverted. For the multitude of thy sins I have dashed thee on the ground; in the presence of kings I have made thee a public example. For the multitude of thy sins and the iniquities of thy traffic I have defiled thy sanctuaries; and from the midst of thee I will bring out a fire which shall devour thee. And I will make thee like ashes on the ground, in the sight of all them who behold thee. And all that knew thee among the nations shall lament over thee. Thou art utterly destroyed and never to be any more.

Then a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, set thy face against Sidon, and prophesy against it and say, Thus saith the Lord, Behold I am against thee, Sidon, and I shall be glorified by thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. When I execute judgments on thee, then shall I be hallowed by thee. There shall be blood and death in thy streets, and the victims of the sword shall fall in and around thee: and they shall know that I am the Lord. And there shall no more be in the house of Israel a pricking briar nor a grieving thorn, by reason of those around them, who despised them: and they shall know that I am the Lord. Thus saith the Lord, Lord, When I gather Israel from among the nations where they were scattered, I shall be hallowed by them even in the sight of the peoples and nations and they shall dwell in their land which I gave to my servant Jacob. And they shall dwell there securely and shall build houses and plant vineyards: they shall indeed dwell securely when I have executed judgment on all who despised them—on all their neighbours around them; and they shall know that I the Lord am their God and the God of their fathers.

XXIX. XIV. IN the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, set thy face against Pharao king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt; and say, Thus saith the Lord, Behold I am against Pharao—that great dragon
which walloweth in the midst of his rivers, and saith, "These rivers are mine and I made them." And I will put grapples in thy jaws, and cause the fishes of thy river to stick close to thy fins; and I will drag thee out of the river, and give thee and all the fishes of thy river a sudden cast. On the face of the plain thou shalt fall and shalt not be gathered nor composed. To the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air I have given thee for food. And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord.

Because thou hast been a staff of reed to the house of Israel; when they took hold of thee with their hand thou didst break: even when every hand was clapping against them, and when they leaned on thee thou didst break and disjoint all their loin; therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I will bring a sword against thee and destroy out of thee man and beast. And the land of Egypt shall be a destruction and a desolation; and they shall know that I am the Lord.

Because thou saidst, "These rivers are mine; I made them;" therefore behold I am against thee and against all thy rivers; and I will deliver up the land of Egypt to desolation and sword and destruction. From Magdolus and Syene even to the borders of Ethiopia, no foot of man shall pass across it, nor shall a foot of beast traverse it; and for forty years it shall not be inhabited. I will indeed make its land a desolation in the midst of a desolated land, and its cities, in the midst of desolated cities, forty years. And I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and disperse them through the countries.

Thus saith the Lord, After forty years, I will gather the Egyptians from the nations where they were scattered; and I will bring back the Egyptian captives, and settle them in the land of Pathora—in the land from which they were taken.—And it shall be the basest of all governments; it shall no more be exalted against the nations. For I will make them few and of little account, that they may not be great among the nations. And they shall no more be the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity into remembrance by their going after them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.

Again it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year on the first day of the first month, that a word of the Lord came to
me, saying, Son of man, Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon hath caused his army to undergo hard service at Tyre. Every head is bald and every shoulder peeled; and he and his army employed against Tyre, have received no wages; though they have undergone hard service against it. Thus saith the Lord, Behold I will give to Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon the land of Egypt. And he shall make a prey of its prey, and a spoil of its spoil. And it shall be wages for his army. For his service which he hath performed against Tyre, I have given him the land of Egypt. Thus saith the Lord, Lord; In that day there shall spring up a horn for the whole house of Israel, and I will give thee an open mouth in the midst of them, and they shall know that I am the Lord.

XXX. Again a word of the Lord came to me saying, Son of man prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord, Alas! alas! the day; for the day of the Lord is near. A cloudy day! it shall be the end of nations. A sword shall come upon the Egyptians; and there shall be consternation in the land of Ethiopia; and the wounded shall fall in Egypt, and its foundations shall be shaken. Persians and Cretans and Lydians and Libyans and all the mixed people, and some of the children of my covenant shall fall in it by the sword. The fortresses of Egypt shall fall, and down shall come the pride of her strength, from Magdolus even to Syene—by the sword they shall fall in it, saith the Lord. And it shall be desolate in the midst of desolated countries; and their cities shall be in the midst of desolated cities. And they shall know that I am the Lord; when I send a fire against Egypt, and all her helpers are trodden down.—In that day swift messengers will go forth to cause Ethiopia to vanish: and there shall be consternation among them in the day of Egypt. For behold it is come.

Thus saith the Lord, Lord, I will indeed destroy the multitude of the Egyptians by the hand of Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon—of him and his people. They are ravagers sent from nations to destroy a land; and they shall all unsheathe their swords against Egypt; and the land shall be filled with the slain. And I will dry up their rivers and destroy the land, and the fulness thereof by the hands of strangers, I the Lord have spoken. For thus saith the Lord, Lord, When
I have destroyed the nobles from Memphis, and the chiefs of Memphis out of the land of Egypt, and they shall be no more; 14 then I will destroy the land of Pathora, and send a fire against 15 Tanis and execute vengeance on Diospolis. And I will pour out my wrath on Sais, the strength of Egypt, and utterly destroy the multitude of Memphis: and I will send a fire against Egypt, and Syene shall be confounded; and at Diospolis there 17 shall be a breach; and water shall gush out. The young men of Heliopolis and Boubaste shall fall by the sword, and the women 18 shall go into captivity. And at Taphnis the day will be darkened, when I there break the sceptres of Egypt, for the pride of her strength shall be destroyed there: and a cloud shall cover 19 her; and her daughters shall be carried away captives. Thus will I execute judgment on Egypt, and they shall know that I am the Lord.

20 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh of the month, a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, I bruised the arms of Pharao king of Egypt; and behold he hath made no supplication for a cure 22 to be given, for a poultice to be applied; for strength to be given to handle a sword, Therefore thus saith the Lord, Lord, Behold I am against Pharao king of Egypt; and I will break his strong and extended arms, and cause the sword to drop 23 from his hand. And I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and 24 disperse them through the countries. And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword into his hand, and he shall wield it against Egypt, and make a prey 25 of his prey, and a spoil of his spoil. I will indeed strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharao shall be enfeebled; and they shall know that I am the Lord. When I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, he shall 26 wield it against the land of Egypt. And I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and disperse them through the countries, and they shall all know that I am the Lord.

XXXI. Again in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, a word of the Lord came to me, saying,
2 Son of man say to Pharao king of Egypt, and to his multitude,
3 to whom hast thou likened thyself for thy loftiness? Lo to Assur! he was a cypress on Libanus. Beautiful with branches
4 and lofty in stature. His top was among the clouds. Water nourished him. The deep made him lofty. It brought its streams about his roots, and sent forth its rills to all the trees 5 of the plain. By reason of this he was exalted in greatness above all the trees of the plain, and by the plentiful supply of 6 water his branches spread. Among his boughs all the birds of the air built their nests; and under his branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young; and all the multitude of nations dwelt in its shade. He was beautiful in his height by the multitude of his branches, because his roots 7 shot out into abundance of water. Even the cypresses such as were in the paradise of God and the pines were not to be compared with his shoots, nor were the fir trees comparable to his branches. Not a tree in the garden of God was equal 8 to him in beauty, on the account of the multitude of his branches; therefore, the trees of God's delicious paradise envied him on that account. But thus saith the Lord, Because thou wast of great magnitude, therefore thou hast shot up thy top among the clouds. Now when I saw that he was lifted up, 9 I delivered him into the hands of the chief of nations, who 10 accomplished his destruction. Strangers, merciless ravagers from nations destroyed him. They felled him on the mountains and his branches fell in all the vallies, and his shoots were trampled down in every field of the earth; and all the tribes of the nations came down from their shade, and levelled 11 him to the ground. Upon his ruins all the birds of the air rested themselves; and all the wild beasts of the earth came against his shoots; that none of the trees by the water might 12 be exalted by their greatness: though they had shot up their top among the clouds, yet none of these water drinkers stood in their height before them; they were all delivered up to death, to the depth of the earth, among the children of men, to 13 them who go down to the pit. Thus saith the Lord, On the day he went down to Hades, the abyss mourned for him. I stayed its streams and restrained the abundance of water. For him Libanus covered itself with darkness; all the trees of the field 14 were grieved for him. At the sound of his fall the nations were shaken. When he was pressed down to the mansion of the dead, with them who go down into the pit; all the trees of the
garden comforted him in the earth—even the choice trees of Libanus, all that drink water; for they also went down with him to the mansion of the dead, among them who were victims of the sword; and his seed—they who dwelt under his shade were in the middle of their life destroyed. To whomsoever thou hast been likened, down with thee, and be pressed low with the trees of pleasure into the depth of the earth. In the midst of the uncircumcised thou shalt lie, with them who are the victims of the swords. Thus shall it be with Pharao and the multitude of his strength, saith the Lord, Lord.

XXXII. Now it came to pass in the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, that a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, take up a funeral song for Pharao king of Egypt, and thou shalt say to him, To the lion of nations thou hast been likened, but thou art like a dragon which is in the sea. Thou hast harried thy rivers and troubled the water with thy feet, and trampled thy rivers. Therefore thus saith the Lord, I will spread for thee the nets of many peoples, and drag thee up with my grapple. And I will lay thee extended on the land. The plains shall be filled. And I will cause all the birds of the air to settle on thee and glut all the beasts of the earth. I will cast thy flesh on the mountains and fill them with thy blood: and the earth shall be drenched with the torrents from thee. By reason of the abundance of thee on the mountains, I will fill the vallies with parcels of thee. And in the act of extinguishing thee I will cover heaven and darken the stars thereof: I will veil the sun with a cloud and the moon shall not give her light: all that give light in the heaven shall be dark over thee; and I will overspread the earth with darkness, saith the Lord, Lord, and vex the heart of many peoples.

When I bring thy captivity to the nations—to a land which thou hast not known; then shall many nations groan for thee: and their kings will be struck with horror, when my sword is brandished before their faces, expecting their own ruin from the day of thy downfall. For thus saith the Lord, the sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee. With the swords of giants I will overthrow thy strength. They are all ravagers from the nations; and they shall destroy the haughtiness of Egypt,
13 and all her strength shall be trampled down. And I will destroy all her cattle from her great water; and the foot of man shall no more trouble it, nor shall a hoof of cattle trample it.

14 Thus shall their waters then be at rest, and their streams shall glide like oil, saith the Lord. When I have devoted Egypt to destruction, and the land is wasted with the fulness thereof—When I have scattered all its inhabitants, then they shall know

16 that I am the Lord. It is a song of woe and thou shalt sing it mournfully, and the daughters of the nations shall bewail Egypt, and over all her strength pour forth this plaint, saith the Lord, Lord.

17 Again in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the first month a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, sing a song of woe over the strength of Egypt, when the nations shall thrust down her daughters—shall thrust them down dead to the depth of the earth—to them who are going down into the pit; in the midst of the sword’s victims they shall fall with him.

When all his power shall be laid to rest; then will the giants say to thee, “Down with thee into the lowest pit! excel whom thou mayst, down with thee, and be laid with the uncircumcised, in the midst of the victims of the sword.” There lieth Assur and all his assembly; all the victims of the sword are laid there; and their sepulture is in the deep pit; and around his tomb is his assembly—all the slain who fell by the sword, who made themselves dreaded in the land of life.

24 There lieth Ailam with all his host around his tomb—all the slain who fell by the sword, and went down uncircumcised to the depth of the earth: having made themselves dreaded in the land of life, they have received their punishment with them who go down to the pit amidst the slain.

26 There are deposited Mosoch and Thobel, each with all his host around his tomb—all his slain, all uncircumcised, slain with the sword. Having made themselves dreaded in the land of life they are laid with the giants who fell of old; who went down in their armour to the mansion of the dead, and had their swords placed under their heads; but their iniquities were on their bones; because they were the terror of all during their lives. Thou indeed shalt be in the midst of the uncir-
cumcised, with them who are the victims of the sword.
29 There have been laid the princes of Assur: they, who gave its strength to the wounding sword, are themselves laid to rest
30 with the slain—with them who go down into the pit. There lie the chiefs of the north, all the generals of Assur, who descending wounded, are with their terror and their strength, laid to rest, uncircumcised with the slain of the sword; and have borne their punishment with them who go down to the pit.
31 These king Pharao shall see and be comforted for all his host,
32 saith the Lord, Lord. Because I have spread the terror of him over the land of life; therefore he shall be in the midst of the uncircumcised, with the slain of the sword—even Pharao and all his multitude with him, saith the Lord, Lord.

XXXIII. XV. AGAIN a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man speak to the children of thy people and thou shalt say to them, With regard to a land on which I am about to bring a sword, when the people of that land take a man, one of themselves, and make him their watchman; if he upon seeing the sword coming against the land, sound the trumpet and warn the people; and he who heareth the trumpet doth not take warning; and the sword cometh and cutteth him off; his blood shall be on his own head. Because upon hearing the sound of the trumpet he did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself; for had he taken warning he might have saved his life. But if the watchman, upon seeing the sword coming, doth not sound the trumpet, and the people are not warned, and the sword cometh and taketh the life of any of them; that person is taken off because of his iniquity; but his blood I will require at the watchman's hands.
7 Now, as for thee son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel, therefore thou shalt hear a word from my mouth. When I say to the sinner, Thou shalt die: if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that unrighteous man shall die for his iniquity; but his blood I will require at thy hand. But if thou forewarn the wicked of his way to turn him from it; and he turn not from it, he shall die for his wickedness and thou hast delivered thy soul.
10 Now son of man, say to the house of Israel, Thus have you spoken, saying, Our errors and our iniquities are upon us; and in them we are pining away; how then can we live? Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord, I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked should turn from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your way. Why do you die, O house of Israel.

12 Say to the children of thy people, The righteousness of a righteous man will not save him on the day when he goeth astray. Nor shall the iniquity of a wicked man bring ruin on him, on the day when he turneth away from his iniquity.

(a) What! cannot a righteous man be saved.

13 (b) When I have spoken to the righteous, if he, trusting to his righteousness, shall commit iniquity, none of his righteous acts shall be remembered; for the iniquity which he hath done, even for it he shall die. And when I say to the wicked, Thou shalt die: if he turn from his sin and execute judgment and justice and restore a pledge and make compensation for acts of rapine and walk in the statutes of life without committing injustice, he shall live and not die. None of his sins which he committed shall be remembered. Because he hath executed judgment and justice, for this he shall live.

17 Now will the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not straight? It is their own way which is not straight. When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and shall commit iniquities, for them he shall die. And when the sinner turneth away from his iniquity and shall execute judgment and justice, for them he shall live. Yet this is what gave occasion to your saying, The way of the Lord is not straight. I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways.

21 XVI. NOW it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the twelfth month, on the fifth of the month, that one who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, The city is taken. Now the hand of the Lord had been upon me

(a) An objection. (b) The answer.
the evening before he arrived, and had opened my mouth. So when he came to me in the morning my mouth was opened and no more shut. And a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, they who dwell in the waste places in the land of Israel, say, Abraham was a single person, yet he had this land, now we are many; to us this land is given for a possession. Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord, Lord, As I live, they who dwell in the wastes shall fall by the sword; and they in the open country shall be delivered to the wild beasts of the field for food: and those in walled towns and those in caves I will destroy with pestilence and I will make the land a desert. And the pride of its strength shall be destroyed, and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate by reason of none passing through it. And they shall know that I am the Lord. For I will make their land a desert and it shall be wasted, because of all their abominations which they have committed.

Now son of man, with regard to these children of thy people who speak of thee by the walls and in the porches of their houses, they indeed speak to one another, saying, "Let us assemble and hear what come from the Lord." They come to thee as people assemble; and they sit before thee and hear thy words, but will not do them, because there is a lie in their mouth, and their heart goeth after their pollutions; therefore thou art to them like the sound of a tuneful psaltery: they will hear thy words, but will not do them: but when they come to pass they will say, "Lo! they are come!" And they will know that there was a prophet among them.

XXXIV. XVII. AGAIN a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel: prophesy and say to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord, Lord, O Shepherds of Israel! Do shepherds feed themselves? Do not the shepherds feed their flocks? Behold you devour the milk and clothe yourselves with the fleeces, and that which is fat you slaughter; but my flock you do not feed. You have not strengthened the weak, nor cured the diseased. That which was bruised you have not bound up, nor brought back that which was going astray; nor have you searched for that which was
5 lost: but you have wearied out the strong with toil, so that my flock is dispersed for want of shepherds, and is become a prey
6 to all the wild beasts of the field. On every mountain and on every high hill my sheep are scattered, and dispersed over the face of the earth; and there is none who seeketh or bringeth
7 them back. Therefore, O shepherds, hear a word of the Lord!
8 As I live, saith the Lord, Because my flock is become a prey, and my sheep are become meat for all the wild beasts of the field, beyond what they would be were there no shepherds; and the shepherds have not looked out for my sheep, and the shepherds have fed themselves and have not tended my sheep;
9 Therefore, O shepherds, thus saith the Lord, Lord, behold I
10 am against the shepherds; and I will exact my sheep out of their hands, and discharge them from feeding my sheep: and these shepherds shall no longer feed them. I will rescue my sheep out of their mouth, that they may be no longer food for
11 them. For thus saith the Lord, Lord, Lo! I myself will seek
12 my sheep and watch over them. As a shepherd searcheth for his flock when mist and murky air overspread his scattered sheep: so will I diligently seek my sheep, and bring them from every place, where they have been dispersed in the day of mist
13 and murky darkness. And I will lead them out from among the nations, and gather them from the countries, and bring them into their own land, and feed them on the mountains of Israel, and in the vales and in all the habitable part of the land.
14 I will feed them in good pasture. On the lofty mountain of Israel shall be their folds; there they shall lie down and rest there in luxurious ease, and be fed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. I myself will feed my sheep and I myself will give them repose, and they shall know that I am the Lord.
16 Thus saith the Lord, Lord, I will seek the lost, and bring back the stray; and bind up the bruised and strengthen the weak: and I will watch the strong, and feed them with judgment. And as for you sheep, thus saith the Lord, Lord, Behold I will judge between sheep and sheep; rams and he
17 goats. Was it not enough for you, that you fed in a rich pasture, but you must tread down the leavings of your pasture with your feet? Or that you have drunk of the standing water,
18 but you must trouble the residue with your feet? So that my
sheep fed on the tramplings of your feet, and drank the water which your feet had muddied. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Lord, Behold I will judge between the strong sheep and the weak. You have pushed with your sides and your shoulders, and have butted with your horns and bruised all the weak: but I will save my sheep and they shall no more be for a prey; and I will judge between ram and ram. And I will set up over them one shepherd who shall feed them, even my servant David, who shall be their shepherd: and I the Lord will be their God; and David shall be chief among them. I the Lord have spoken; and with this David I will make a covenant of peace, and remove the wild beasts entirely out of the land; so that they may dwell in the desert and sleep in the woods. And I will place them around my mountain, and give them the rain—the rain of blessing: and the trees of the plain shall yield their fruit; and the earth shall yield its increase; and they shall dwell in their land securely; And know that I am the Lord, when I have broken their yoke: and I will rescue them out of the hand of them who enslaved them, and they shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the wild beasts of the earth any more devour them, so they shall dwell secure and none shall make them afraid. I will indeed raise up for them a plant of peace, and they shall no more be consumed with famine in the land; nor shall they any more bear the revile of nations; and they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and that they are my people. O house of Israel, saith the Lord, Lord, you are my sheep, even the sheep of my flock, and I, the Lord, am your God, saith the Lord, Lord.

XXXV. XVIII. AGAIN a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, set thy face against the mountain of Seir, and prophesy against it and say to it, Thus saith the Lord, Lord, Behold I am against thee, mountain of Seir; and I will stretch forth my hand against thee, and make thee a desert and thou shalt be desolate. And I will make a devastation among thy cities, and thou shalt be a desert and shalt know that I am the Lord. Because thou hast been a perpetual enemy and didst deceitfully lie in wait for the house of Israel—hast been a sword in the hand of enemies, in the time of revolt, in their last ex-
6 tremities; therefore as I live, saith the Lord, Lord, as thou hast sinned unto blood, blood shall pursue thee. And I will make the mountain of Seir an entire desert; and I will destroy from it men and cattle, and fill with the wounded thy hills and thy vallies: and in all thy plains, the victims of the sword shall fall in thee. I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall no more be inhabited, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. Because thou saidst, "The two nations and the two countries shall be mine, and I will possess them, though the Lord is there." Therefore, as I live saith the Lord, I will deal with thee according to thine enmity, and be made known to thee, when I judge thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. I have heard the sound of thy revilings; because thou saidst, "The waste mountains of Israel are given us to be devoured," and didst utter swelling words against me with thy mouth: I heard them: therefore thus saith the Lord, to the joy of the whole land I will make thee a desert. Thou mountain of Seir shalt be a desert; and all Idumea shall be destroyed; and thou shalt know that I the Lord am their God.

XXXVI. And thou son of man, prophesy concerning the mountains of Israel, and say to the mountains of Israel, Hear a word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord, Lord; For as much as against you the enemy said, "Aha! these everlasting deserts are become our possession;" therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord, Lord, For as much as you have been despised and hated by them around you, by reason of your being a possession for the relics of nations; and you are become a by-word and scoff to the nations: therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear a word of the Lord, Thus saith the Lord, to the mountains and the hills, and to the brooks and vallies, even to the waste and desolate places, and to the cities which have been utterly forsaken; as they are become a prey and a haunt for the remnants of nations around; Therefore thus saith the Lord, Lord, In the fire of my wrath I have spoken against these remnants of nations and against all Idumea: Because they have with joy distributed this land of mine among themselves for a possession, undervaluing lives that you might be a waste for prey; therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and hills and to the vales and forests, Thus saith the
7 Lord, Behold in my zeal and my wrath I have spoken; for as much as you have borne the reproach of the nations; therefore I will lift up my hand against the nations around you; they shall bear their own dishonour: but your grapes and your fruits, O mountains of Israel, shall be eaten by my people. Because they have confident hopes of coming—because, lo! I am over you, and I will watch over you; therefore you shall be cultivated and sown: and upon you I will multiply men, even the whole house of Israel; and the cities shall be rebuilt and the wastes inhabited: and upon you I will multiply men and cattle, and cause you to be inhabited as in your former state. And I will deal kindly with you as I did in times of old; and you shall know that I am the Lord. And I will cause men, my people Israel, to increase upon you; and they shall inherit you, and you shall be a possession for them, and shall no more be without a succession of children from them.

13 Thus saith the Lord, Lord, For as much as they said of thee, "Thou art a devourer of men, and art bereft of thy nation," Therefore thou shalt no more devour men nor make thy nation childless, saith the Lord, Lord. And the revile of nations shall no more be heard against you, nor shall you any more bear the reproaches of peoples, saith the Lord, Lord.

16 Again a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their land, they polluted it with their way and with their idols and with their impurities; and their way was in my view as the uncleanness of a woman in a state of separation; therefore I poured out my wrath against them, and scattered them through the nations, and dispersed them through the countries: according to their way and according to their sin I judged them. And when they went to the nations, wherever they went they profaned my holy name, by saying that they were the people of the Lord and had come from his land; and that I had spared them for the sake of that holy name of mine, which they, the house of Israel, profaned among the nations wherever they went. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, I deal thus with you, not for your sakes, O house of Israel, but only for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations wherever you went. For I will hallow my great name which hath been
profaned, which you have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, when I am hallowed by you before their eyes. When I take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and bring you into your own land; then I will sprinkle upon you pure water, and you shall be cleansed from all your impurities and from all your idols; and when I have cleansed you, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you: I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and give you a heart of flesh: And I will put my spirit in you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and to keep my judgments and practise them. And you shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers; and you shall be my people and I will be your God. And I will save you from all your impurities. And I will call for corn and multiply it: and no more send famine among you. And I will multiply the fruit of the trees and the products of the field; that you may no more bear the reproach of famine among the nations. Then will you call to remembrance your evil ways, and your devices which were not good; and in their sight be grieved for your iniquities and your abominations. It is not for your sakes that I do this, saith the Lord, Lord. This you must needs know. Blush and be ashamed for your ways, O house of Israel.

Thus saith Adonai the Lord, when I have cleansed you from all your iniquities, I will cause your cities to be rebuilded and the desolate places shall be inhabited, and the land which was a waste shall be tilled. For as much as it was a waste in the sight of all who passed by; therefore they will say, "This land which was a waste is become like a paradise, and the waste, ruined and demolished cities are become places of strength;" and the nations which may be left around you shall know, that I the Lord have rebuilt the ruined cities, and planted the grounds which were a waste. I the Lord have spoken and I will perform. Thus saith Adonai the Lord, Still that they may do this, the house of Israel must seek me.—I will multiply them like a flock, the men like holy flocks, like the flocks of Jerusalem at her festivals. So shall the wasted cities be filled with flocks of men, and they shall know that I am the Lord.
XXXVII. Then the hand of the Lord came upon me. And the Lord led me out in spirit and set me in the midst of a plain which was full of human bones. And he led me all around them. And lo! there was an immense quantity on the surface of the plain, and they were very dry. And he said to me, Son of man, shall these bones revive? Whereupon I said, Lord, Lord, thou knowest such things.

Then he said to me, Prophesy concerning these bones and say to them, Ye bones which are dry, hear a word of the Lord, Thus saith the Lord to these bones, Behold I will bring upon you a breath of life; and upon you I will lay sinews; and I will bring flesh on you and stretch skin over you, and put my breath in you and you shall live: and you shall know, that I am the Lord.

So I prophesied as he commanded me, and it came to pass that, when I had prophesied, behold there was a tremulous motion and it brought the bones together, every one to its proper place. And I beheld and lo! sinews and flesh were grown upon them, and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.

Then he said to me, Prophesy to the wind. Prophesy, Son of man and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord, From the four winds, come and blow on these dead and let them live.

So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath came into them and they became alive and stood on their feet, an exceeding great multitude.

Then the Lord spoke to me saying, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Now they say, "Our bones are become dry. Our hope is gone. We are wasted to a shadow." Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord, Behold I will open your graves; and bring you up out of your tombs and bring you into the land of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord.

When I have opened your graves that I may bring up my people out of the graves I will then put my breath in you and you shall live. And I will settle you in your own land; and you shall know that I am the Lord. I have spoken and I will perform, saith the Lord.
15 Then a word of the Lord came to me saying, Son of man, take thee a staff and write thereon, "Juda and the children of Israel who adhere to him," Then thou shalt take thee another staff and write thereon, "For Joseph the staff of Ephraim and all the children of Israel who adhere to him."
16 Then thou shalt join them one to the other to be bound together into one staff for thee, and they shall be in thy hand.
18 And when the children of thy people say to thee, Why dost thou not tell us, what thou meanest by these? Then thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord, Behold I will take the tribe of Joseph which is administered by Ephraim and the tribes of Israel which adhere to him, and add them to the tribe of Juda, and they shall be one sceptre in the hand of Juda. And while the staves on which thou hast written shall be in thy hand before them, thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord, Lord, Behold I will take the whole house of Israel from among the nations, whither they went; and I will gather them from all those around them, and bring them to the land of Israel, and make them a nation in my land even on the mountains of Israel. And there shall be one chief over them. And they shall no more be two nations; nor shall they any more be split into two kingdoms, that they may no more be polluted with their idols. And I will deliver them from all their iniquities and purify them from all their sins which they have committed. And they shall be my people, and I the Lord will be their God. And my servant David shall be chief among them. He shall be singly the shepherd of all. Because they will walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and practise them, therefore they shall dwell in that land of theirs which I gave to my servant Jacob. Where their fathers dwelt there they shall dwell and my servant David shall be the only chief forever. And I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place my sanctuary in the midst of them forever. And my habitation shall be among them; and I will be their God and they shall be my people. And the nations shall know that I am the Lord who sanctifieth them, by my sanctuary being in the midst of them forever.
XXXVIII.    XIX.    AGAIN a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, set thy face against Gog, and the land of Magog, the prince of Ros, Mesoch and Thobel and prophesy against him and say to him,
3    Thus saith the Lord, Lord, Behold I am against thee,
4    prince of Ros, Mesoch and Thobel. And I will gather thee and all thine army, horses and horsemen all clad with coats of mail—a great assembly with shields and helmets and swords,
5    Persians and Ethiopians and Libyans, all armed with helmets and shields; Gomer and all those around him, the house of Thogarmar, from the extreme north, with all around him and many nations with thee. Be prepared and make thyself ready, thou and thy multitude assembled with thee; for thou shalt be to me for a vanguard. After many days he will be in a state of preparation, and in the last of years he will begin his march, and come into the land which is withdrawn from the sword—the land of them who have been collected from many nations, to the land of Israel, which had been made an entire desert.—When he from nations hath begun his march, they will be all dwelling in peace. Then thou wilt come up like rain, and advance like a cloud to cover the land. When thou shalt be with all thy bands around thee, and many nations with thee; (Thus saith the Lord, Lord,) In that day things will come into thy heart, and thou wilt form wicked devices and say,
11    "I will go up against an abject land: I shall come upon them who are living at ease, and dwelling in peaceful security—all inhabiting a land in which there is not a walled town, and who have neither bars nor gates; to take prey and to gather their spoils, by turning my hand against this wasted country which is re-settled, and against a nation gathered together from many nations who have gotten wealth and inhabit the navel of the earth."
13    Saba and Daidan and the merchants of Carthage, and all their colonies, will say to thee, Thou art coming for prey, just to collect plunder and spoil: thou hast assembled thy troops to take silver and gold, to carry off cattle, to gather the spoil. Therefore prophesy Son of man and say to Gog, Thus saith the Lord, At the time when my people Israel shall be dwelling in peace, wilt thou not be roused? Yes; thou wilt
come from thy place, from the extremity of the north: thou and many nations with thee, all mounted on horses, a great assembly, and a mighty army, will indeed come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: in the latter days I will bring thee up against my land, that all the nations may know me when I am hallowed by thee in their sight.

Thus saith the Lord, Lord, to Gog, Thou art he of whom I have spoken in former times, by the ministry of my servants the prophets of Israel, that in these days and years I would bring thee up against them. But it shall come to pass on that day, on the day when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, my wrath shall come up, saith the Lord, Lord, and my zeal. In the fire of mine indignation, I have spoken, there shall indeed be on that day a great shock in the land of Israel.

At the presence of the Lord, the fishes of the sea shall be shaken, and the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field, and all the reptiles which creep on the earth, and all the men on the face of the earth. And the mountains shall be rent to pieces, and the vallies shall sink down, and every wall shall fall to the ground. And for all this indeed I will call up terror saith the Lord: every man's sword shall be against his brother.

And I will execute judgment on him, with pestilence and blood and with tempests of rain and hailstones; and I will rain down fire and brimstone on him, and on all with him, even on the many nations with him. And I shall be magnified and hallowed and glorified; and made known in the sight of many nations, and they shall know that I am the Lord.

Thou therefore son of man, prophesy against Gog and say, Thus saith the Lord, Lord, Behold I am against thee, Gog, the prince of Ros, Mesoch and Thobel, and I will assemble thee and lead thee and cause thee to come from the farthest north, and bring thee up to the mountains of Israel; and I will destroy thy bow from thy left hand and thine arrows from thy right; and overthrow thee on the mountains of Israel; and thou and all who are around thee shall fall; and the nations with thee shall be given to multitudes of birds, to all the feathered tribe, and to all the wild beasts of the field I have given thee to be devoured. On the open field thou shalt fall;
6 for I have spoken, saith the Lord. I will indeed send a fire against Gog and the isles shall be peaceably inhabited, and
7 they shall know that I am the Lord. And my holy name shall be known in the midst of my people Israel; and my name which is holy shall no more be profaned; and the nations shall
8 know that I am the Lord, the Holy One of Israel. Behold it is coming and thou shalt know that it will be, saith the Lord,
9 Lord; this is the day of which I have spoken, when they who inhabit the cities of Israel shall come forth, and make fires with the arms—with the shields and spears, and with bows and arrows, and hand-staves and poles—even with these they shall make
10 fires seven years: so that they shall not have occasion to take wood from the plains, nor to cut timber from the forests; but shall burn the arms only. And they shall plunder their plunderers; and spoil those who spoiled them, saith the Lord. And on that day I will give Gog a noted place—a burying place in Israel, the grave yard of strangers by the sea shore: and the slope of the valley shall be enclosed with a wall; and there Gog and all his multitude shall be buried; and it shall then be
12 called the grave yard of Gog. For the house of Israel will bury
13 them, that the land may be cleansed. During seven months the people of the land will be employed in burying them; and it shall be to them a memorable epoch, "The day when he was glorified," saith the Lord. Then they will send men every where to traverse the land, and bury them who are left on the face of the ground, in order to purify it after the seven months. And
15 they will make diligent search. And every one who traverseth the land, upon seeing a human bone, shall set up a mark near it;
16 till the buriers bury it at Gai, the grave yard of Gog: (for the name of that city shall be called Grave Yard) thus shall the land be cleansed.
17 Thou, therefore, son of man, say, Thus saith the Lord, Say to every winged bird, and to all the wild beasts of the field, Assemble and come: assemble from all around to my sacrifice, to the great sacrifice which I have made for you on the mountains of Israel; and you shall eat flesh and drink
18 blood. You shall eat the flesh of giants and drink the blood of the princes of the earth. Rams and young bulls and he goats; and all the bulls are well fatted. And you shall eat fat till you
are glutted, and drink blood to satiety, at my sacrifice which I have prepared for you. And you shall be filled at my table with horses and horsemen, and with giants and every great warrior, saith the Lord. I will indeed display my glory among you, and all the nations shall see my judgment which I have executed, and my hand which I have brought upon them. And the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from this particular time and thence forward. And all the nations shall know, that the house of Israel were carried into captivity for their sins. Because they broke covenant with me therefore I turned away my face from them, and delivered them into the hands of their enemies, and they all fell by the sword. According to their pollutions and according to their iniquities I dealt with them and turned away my face from them. Therefore thus saith the Lord, I will now bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have compassion on the house of Israel. And I will shew a zeal for my holy name, when they shall have suffered disgrace, for the rebellion of which they were guilty, when they dwelt peaceably in their own land. And there shall be none to make them afraid, when I have brought them back from among the nations and gathered them from the countries of the nations. So I shall be hallowed by them in the sight of the nations and they shall know that I the Lord am their God, when I manifest myself to them among the nations. And I will no more turn away my face from them, for as much as I have poured out my wrath on the house of Israel, saith the Lord, Lord.

XL. XX. IN the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the first month, on the tenth day of the month; the fourteenth year after the city was taken; on that day the hand of the Lord came upon me and in a vision of God brought me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on which there was a building before me resembling a city. And he led me thither. And lo! a man, whose appearance resembled that of sparkling brass; and in his hand a builder's line and a measuring reed. And he stood at the gate. And the man whom I saw said to me, Son of man, Behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears, and lay up in thy heart all that I shew thee; for thou
art come hither that I may shew thee and that thou mayst point out to the house of Israel all that thou seest.

5 Now behold there was a wall on the outside of the house all around; and the man had in his hand a reed of six cubits long by the cubit and hand breadth, so he measured the outer wall. The breadth equalled the reed and its height was equal to the reed. Then he went up by seven steps to the gate fronting the east and measured the ailam of the gate which was one reed broad; and the Thieē was a reed long and a reed broad—and the ailam between the Theelath was six cubits. And the second Thieē was a reed long and a reed broad and the ailam was five cubits; and the third Thieē was a reed long and a reed broad. And the ailam of the gateway adjoining the ailam of the gate was eight cubits, and the aileus were two cubits. And with regard to the aliems of the gate on the inside and the Thieēs of the gate; the Thieēs were opposite to those without; three on one side of the gate and three on the other, all of the same measure on this side and on that. And the ailams on both sides were of the same measure. Then he measured the breadth of the door of the gateway ten cubits. But the breadth of the gateway was thirteen cubits comprehending a border of a cubit on each side up to the face of the Thieēs: and the Thieēs on each side were six cubits. Then he measured the gate from the outer wall of one Thieē to the outer wall of the other Thieē twenty five cubits. This was gate upon gate. And the open part of the ailam of the gate on the outside was twenty cubits, the theims of the gate being round about; and including this vestibule of the gate on the outside and the vestibule of the gate on the inside the extent was fifty cubits. And all around there were windows wide inwards and narrow outwards, for the theims and the inner ailams of this gate of the court: and on the windows for the ailams on the inside and on the ailams there were palm trees on this side and that. Then he led me to the court within; and lo! here were houses for those employed in the holy service and ranges of columns all around the court; there were thirty houses in the peristyles or ranges of columns and the porticos were behind the gate; the lower row of columns being on a range with the gates.
19 Then he measured the breadth of this court from the inner vestibule of the outer gate to the outer vestibule of a gate facing the east, one hundred cubits. Then he led me northward, and lo! there was a gate to this outer court facing the north, and he measured it, both the length and the breadth; 21 and the Thee's three on each side and the aileus and the ailammons and its palm trees. And the measures were the same as those of the gate facing the east. Its length was fifty cubits 22 and its breadth twenty five cubits. And its windows and the ailammons and its palm trees were the same as those of the eastern gate and the ascent to it was by seven steps. But the ailammons were on the inside. And there was a gate to the inner court facing this northern gate in the same manner as the other did that to the east. And he measured the court from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.

24 Then he led me southward, and lo! there was a gate facing the south, and he measured it, and the Thee's and the aileus and the ailammons: and the measures were the same as those mentioned. And its windows and the ailammons around were the same as the windows of that other ailam. Its length 26 was fifty cubits and its breadth twenty five cubits. And it had seven steps and an ailammon on the inside. It had also 27 palm trees on each side over the aileus. And this gate was directly opposite to the south gate of the inner court; and he measured the court from gate to gate and the breadth on the south side was a hundred cubits.

28 Then he led me to the inner court of the gate facing the south, and he measured that gate, and its dimensions were the same as those mentioned, and its Thee's and its aileus and its ailammons were of the like dimensions. And there were windows to it and to the ailammon round about. Its length was fifty cubits and the breadth of its ailam on the outer court was twenty five cubits, and there were palm trees over the aileus and it had eight steps.

32 Then he led me to the gate facing the east, and measured it according to the same measures. And its Thee's and its aileus and its ailammons were of the measures above mentioned and it had windows and an ailammon round about. Its length was 34 fifty cubits and its breadth twenty five cubits. And its ailam-
mon was on the inner court, and there were palm trees over the aileu on each side. And there were eight steps up to it.

35 Then he led me to the north gate and measured it according to the same measures. And it had its Thee's and its aileus and its ailammons and its windows around it, and an ailamon peculiar to it. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty five cubits. And its ailammons were on the outer court, and there were palm trees to the aileu, on each side and eight steps up to it. Its houses for the priests, and its doors and its ailammon were at the second gate. At this gate facing the north there was a common sewer, that they might there kill the sin offerings and the trespass offerings. And behind the sewer of the burnt offerings there were at this gate facing the north, two tables facing the east. Also back of the second gate, and of the ailam of the gate were two tables on the east side. There were four on one side, and four on the other, back of this gate. Upon these they slay the burnt offerings. And over against these eight tables for the burnt offerings, there were four tables of hewn stone for the whole burnt offerings. The breadth of these was a cubit and a half, and the length two cubits and half, and the height one cubit. On these are to be laid the instruments with which they kill the whole burnt offerings and the sacrifices. They have therefore each of them a border of a hand breadth hewn on the inside all around; and over these tables there is a covering to defend them from the rain, and the heat of the sun.

44 Then he led me into the inner court; and lo! there were two apartments on the inner court; one behind the north gate facing the south; and one behind the south gate facing the north. And he said to me, This apartment which faceth the south is for the priests, who keep the watch of the house, and that apartment facing the north is for the priests who have the charge of the altar, namely the sons of Sadduk, the only Levites who come near to the Lord to minister to him. Then he measured this court which was a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits broad, being four square. And the altar was on one side in front of the house.

48 Then he led me to the ailam of the house and measured the ail of the ailam, five cubits the breadth on each side and
the width of the gateway was fourteen cubits; and the cheeks of the door of the ailam were three cubits on the one side and three cubits on the other. And the length of the ailam was twenty cubits and the breadth twelve cubits; and the ascent up to it was by ten steps. And there were pillars on the ailam, one on the one side and one on the other.

XLI. Then he led me into the temple, and having measured the ailam to it, which was six cubits broad on each side, and the breadth of the gateway was ten cubits, and the cheeks of the gateway five cubits on the one side, and five on the other, he measured the length of the temple forty cubits, and the breadth was twenty cubits. Now when he came to the inner apartment he measured the ail of the door two cubits, and the door six cubits, and the cheeks of the door seven cubits on each side. And he measured the length of the doors forty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits, commensurate with the front of the temple. And he said, This is the Holy of Holies. Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits, and the breadth of the gallery four cubits all around. And the galleries were three times thirty; one gallery over another twice. And there was a ledge in the wall of the house for the galleries all around to rest on, so as not to be fastened into the walls of the house, and consequently this ledge of the house being added to the upper gallery, all around the width of the upper gallery was enlarged, by an additional breadth equal to this ledge as one ascended from the lowermost to the second story, and from the second to the third story. And the thrael of the house—the top of the galleries around, including the ledges, was a platform equal to the reed of six cubits. And the breadth of the wall on the out side of the gallery, was five cubits.—And the vacancies between the galleries of the house, and the chambers were in breadth twenty cubits, including the circumambient wall around the house. And the doors of the chambers were on the vacancy on the one side of the house facing the north, and on the other side of the house facing the south. Now the vacancy for lighting the house was five cubits all around. And the partition wall in front of this vacancy was towards the west, seventy cubits broad; its thickness all around being five cubits; and its length was ninety cubits.
13 And he measured over against the house a length of a hundred cubits. Now the vacancies and the partitions and their walls were a hundred cubits. And the breadth in front of the house including the vacancies on the sides was a hundred cubits. And he measured the length of the partition wall over against the vacancy behind the house, and the length of it including the vacancies on each side, was a hundred cubits.

16 Now the temple and the corners, and the outer ailam were arched; and the windows, the apertures for light through which they looked out from the three stories round about, were netted, and the parts adjoining were planked, both the floor and from the floor to the windows. And the windows in the three stories, had shutters which folded back, to give an opportunity of looking out at them. And near to the inner, and quite to the outer door, there were sculptured, on the whole wall round about, both within and without, cherubims and palm trees between cherub and cherub. Every cherub had two faces, a face of a man towards the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion towards the palm tree on the other side. The house was sculptured all around. From the floor to the vaulted cieling there were cherubim and palm trees sculptured. And the sanctuary and the open temple were squares. In front of the Holies there was an appearance like that of an altar of wood. The height of it was three cubits, and the length two cubits, and the breadth two cubits. And it had horns. And its base and its sides were of wood. And he said to me, This is the table which is in the presence of the Lord. And the temple had two doors, and the sanctuary had two doors. And these pairs of doors which folded back had two leaves a piece. And on these there was sculpture. Even upon the doors of the temple there were cherubim and palm trees like the sculpture of the Holies. And there were large beams on the front of the outer ailam, and windows narrow without and wide inwards.

XLII. Now when he had measured on this side and that to the cieling of the ailam and to the galleries adjoining the house, he then led me into the inner court on the east, conducting me towards the north gate. And lo! there were five chambers adjoining the vacancy and the north partition wall, in length fronting:
3 the north one hundred cubits and in breadth fifty cubits, sculptured in the same manner as the gates of the inner court and set off in the same manner as the peristyles of the outer court with
4 a triple range of piazzas in front of the house. And over against the chambers was a walk ten cubits broad and a hundred cubits long and their doors were towards the north. And in like manner there were walks for the upper stories. For the upper piazza was taken from the building and out of that which was a piazza below was made a platform. So there was a piazza and a platform; and this was the case with two of the piazzas, for there were three one above another.—But they had not pillars like the pillars of the outer piazzas; therefore the upper chambers were straightened more than the middle and the middle more than those on the ground. And they had light from without in the same manner as the chambers of the outer court, in front of these chambers on the north, the extent being fifty cubits. For the chambers which looked into the outer court were fifty cubits deep and were the fore front of these. The whole building was a hundred cubits long. Now there were doors of these chambers opening into an entry facing the east. So there was a passage through them from the outer court along this entry to the lighted walk at the head of this passage. And with regard to those on the south in front of that vacancy and in front of that partition wall, both the chambers and the walk before them were of the same measures as those of the chambers on the north. Their length was the same; and their breadth the same. And all their outlets and all their windings were the same; and their lights and their doors the same. And these chambers on the south had in like manner doors from the head of the walk into an entry which was a reed broad and gave a passage to the east. And he said to me, these chambers on the north and those on the south which are in front of the vacancies, are the chambers of the sanctuary, in which the priests the sons of Sadduk, who come near to the Lord, are to eat the holy meats and where they are to lay up the most holy things, the sacrifice and the sin offerings and the trespass offerings. Because this is a holy place, none but the priests are to go in there. That they who offer up the offerings may be continually holy, and that none may touch
the garments in which they minister because they are holy, the priests must not go out from the sanctuary into the outer court. And when they are to mix with the people they must put on other garments.

15 Now when he had completed the measuring of the inner house, he then led me out by the way of the gate facing the east
16 and measured the plot of the house all around in order. Having taken a station behind the gate facing the east he measured
17 ed five hundred cubits with the measuring reed. Then turning at the north he measured the north side five hundred cu-
18 bits with his measuring reed. Then turning at the west he measured the west side five hundred with his measuring reed;
19 then turning at the south he measured five hundred with his
20 measuring reed. The four sides of the height and breadth of this same reed. And he appointed this, namely, the surrounding parapet wall which was five hundred cubits on the east side and five hundred cubits broad to make a separation be-
tween the Holies and the vacant space before the wall, which was to be comprehended in the plot of the house.

XLIII. Then he brought me to the gate facing the east and
2 led me out, and lo! the glory of the God of Israel was coming
3 by the way of the east; and the sound of his march was like the sound of redoubling multitudes and the earth glared with the splendour of the glory around. And the vision which I saw was like that which I beheld when I went to judge the city. And the appearance of the chariot which I saw was the
4 same as that which I saw at the river Chobar. So I fell on my face. And the glory of the Lord entered the house by the way
5 of the gate which faced the east. Then a spirit took me up and brought me to the inner court. And lo! the house was fill-
6 ed with the glory of the Lord. So I stopped. And lo! a voice from the house, of one speaking to me, and the man stood
7 near me. And he said to me, Son of man, Thou hast seen the place of my throne and the place of my footsteps, where my name should dwell in the midst of the house of Israel for-
ever, that the house of Israel may no more profane my holy name; neither they nor their leaders, by their fornication and
8 by the murders of their leaders in the midst of them. By their joining my porch to their porches and their thresholds to my
thresholds they made my wall as it were common to me and them and profaned my holy name by their iniquities which they committed. Therefore I destroyed them with my wrath and with slaughter. But now let them put away their fornication and the murders of their rulers far from me; and I will dwell in the midst of them forever. And thou son of man, shew the house of Israel this house and let them cease from their sins. Point out the figure and arrangement of it; and let them receive their punishment for all that they have done. Delineate the house and its outlets and its whole figure and make known to them the ordinances thereof and all the rites thereof. And that they may keep my rules of rectitude and all my ordinances and practise them, thou shalt sketch out in their sight the draft of this house on the top of this mountain, all the boundaries of it round about being Holy of Holies.

Now these are the measures of the altar by the cubit of a cubit and a hand breadth—the curvature at the bottom a cubit, that is the breadth of a cubit; and the border upon the edge of it round about, a span. And this is the height of the altar—from the lowest part of the beginning of its curvature to the great propitiatory from beneath, two cubits; and its breadth a cubit: and from the little propitiatory four cubits and its breadth a cubit. Then the ariel four cubits and from the ariel and upwards the horns one cubit. And the ariel is twelve cubits long by twelve broad, the four angles and sides being equal. And the propitiatory is fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits broad, its four sides being equal. And the border encircling it all around is half a cubit; and the compass of it a cubit all around. And the steps up to it face the east.

Then he said to me, Son of man, Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, These are the ordinances of the altar on the day when they make it, to offer thereon whole burnt offerings and to pour blood upon it. Thou shalt give a young bull from the herd for a sin offering to the priests, the Levites of the house of Sadduk who come near to me, saith the Lord God, to minister to me; and they shall take some of the blood thereof and put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the altar, and on the base round about and make atonement
21 for it. Then they shall take the young bull for the sin offering and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house without the Holies. And on the second day they shall take two kids of the goats without blemish for a sin offering and make atonement for the altar as they did with the young bull. 23 And after finishing this atonement they shall offer a young bull from the herd without blemish, and a ram from the flock without blemish. And you shall present them before the Lord; and the priests shall throw salt upon them, and carry them up as whole burnt offerings for the Lord. For seven days thou shalt offer every day a kid for a sin offering and a young bull from the herd and a ram from the flock. For seven days they shall offer these sacrifices without blemish, and make atonement for the altar and purify it and shall fill their own hands. 27 And from the eighth day and thenceforward the priests shall sacrifice upon the altar your whole burnt offerings and your offerings of thanksgiving and I will accept you, saith the Lord.

XLIV. Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of these holy places, facing the east, and it was shut. And the Lord said to me, This gate shall be kept shut. It shall not be opened, nor shall any pass through it. Because the Lord God of Israel will enter in at it, therefore it shall be kept shut. Consequently, when the ruler himself shall sit there to eat bread before the Lord, he shall come in by the way of the ailam of this gate and by that way he shall go out.

4 Then he brought me in by the way of the north gate over against the house, and I beheld and lo! the house of the Lord was filled with glory and I fell on my face. And the Lord said to me, Son of man, Lay up in thy heart and see with thine eyes and hear with thine ears, all that I say to thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord and all the customs thereof; and thou shalt attend diligently to the way of entering into the house and to all the ways out of it in all these holy places. And thou shalt say to this provoking house, to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, Let it suffice you,

7 O house of Israel, for all your iniquities, that you have introduced strangers, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be present in these holy places of mine and to profane them when you were offering loaves, flesh meat and
8 blood. You indeed broke my covenant by all your iniquities and you appointed them to keep the watches in my holy places.
9 Therefore thus saith the Lord God, No stranger, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh shall enter into my holy places. Among all the sons of other families which are comprehended in the house of Israel none but the Levites only shall enter. Such of these as were drawn away from me when Israel strayed from me after their own desires shall indeed bear their iniquity and be ministering servants in my sanctuary.
11 They shall be porters at the gates of the house and ministering servants for the house. They shall kill the sacrifices and the whole burnt offerings for the people and they shall stand before the people to wait upon them. Because they waited on them before their idols, and this brought on Israel the punishment of rebellion; therefore I have lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord God, that they shall not come near me to minister to me as priests, nor approach the holy things of the children of Israel, nor to my Holy of Holies; but shall bear their dishonour for the error of which they have been guilty.
14 And they shall be compelled to keep the watches of the house, to perform all the services of the house and all the services required of them by the priests, the Levites, the sons of Sad-duk. These kept the watches of my sanctuary when the house of Israel strayed from me. These shall approach me to minister to me. And they shall stand before me to offer unto me sacrifice, suet and blood, saith the Lord God. These shall enter into my sanctuary; and these shall come to my table to minister to me. And they shall keep my watches. And when they enter the gates of the inner court, they shall be dressed in linen robes and shall not wear woollens, while they are officiating within the gate of the inner court. And they shall have linen mitres on their heads, and linen drawers about their loins. And they shall not be tightly girded. And when they are going out into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their linen robes in which they minister and lay them up in the chambers of the sanctuary and put on other robes. For with those robes of theirs they must not hallow the people. Moreover they shall not shave their heads, nor pull out their hair by the roots. They shall keep their heads covered. And none of
the priests shall drink wine when they go into the inner court
22 Moreover they shall not take to wife a widow, nor one who hath been divorced; but only a virgin of the race of Israel. However, if there be a widow of a priest, they may take her.
23 And they shall teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is common, and cause them to distinguish
24 between clean and unclean. And they shall attend at trials for blood to pronounce sentence. They shall acquit according to my statutes, and condemn according to my judgments. And they shall keep all my rites and mine ordinances at all my festivals and shall hallow my sabbaths. And they shall not go in where there is a person dead, to defile themselves. Only for a father or for a mother, or for a son or for a daughter, or for a brother or for a sister that hath not been married, shall a priest
26 defile himself. And after he is purified thou shalt reckon for
27 him seven days. And on the day when they go into the inner court to officiate in the sanctuary they shall offer an atonement,
28 saith the Lord God. Now with regard to their inheritance I will be their inheritance, therefore no possession shall be given them among the sons of Israel.
29 Because I am their possession, therefore they shall eat the sacrifices and the sin offerings and the offerings for inadvertencies. Moreover every dedication in Israel shall be for them.—All the first fruits and all the firstlings and all oblations. Of all your first fruits a part shall be for the priests, therefore you shall give your first fruits to the priest that your
31 blessings may rest on your houses. But whatever hath died of itself and whatever hath been torn by wild beasts, whether it be of fowls or of cattle, the priests shall not eat.

XLV. Moreover when you parcel out the land for possessions, you shall set apart for the Lord an oblation from the land, a holy portion twenty five thousand cubits in length and twenty
2 thousand cubits in breadth. It shall be holy in all its borders round about. And out of this shall be the holy portions, five hundred cubits by five hundred cubits, a square all around, and
3 a vacancy of fifty cubits all around it. Out of the measurement, when thou shalt measure off a length of twenty five thousand and a breadth of twenty thousand, part shall be for the Holy of Holies and part shall be for the priests who minister in the
4 sanctuary. There shall be both for them who draw near to minister to the Lord, and there shall be for the others, a place 5 for houses set apart in their holy portions. The length of twenty five thousand and the breadth of twenty thousand shall be for the Levites who serve in the house. They shall have for 6 a possession cities to dwell in. And for the possession of the city thou shalt give five thousand in breadth and twenty five thousand in length. This, in the same manner as that set apart for the sanctuary, shall belong to the whole house of Israel. 7 And on each side of these there shall be allotted for the ruler, adjoining the holy oblation and the possession of the city, the tracts in front of the holy oblation and the possession of the city, both westward and eastward; and the length shall be like one of the portions from the boundaries on the sea to the eastern border of the land. And this shall be his possession in Israel. And the rulers of Israel shall no more oppress my people and the house of Israel shall possess the land according to their tribes.

9 Thus saith the Lord God, let this suffice you; O princes of Israel. Put an end to injustice and misery. Execute judgment and justice. Remove oppression from my people, saith the Lord God. Let your weights and measures be just. Let 11 your chenix be the just part of the measure; and let the chenix uniformly contain the tenth of a gomar. Let a chenix and 12 a tenth of a gomar, as it respecteth a gomar, be equal. And the weights shall be twenty oboli, five shekels, fifteen shekels. And fifty shekels shall be your mna.

13 Now this shall be the oblation which you shall set apart, a 14 sixth of a measure from the gomar of wheat and the sixth of the same ephah from the core of barley. And the ordinance of oil shall be one cotula of oil from ten cotulas; for the ten cotulas are a gomar. And a sheep from the flock, from every ten, shall be an oblation from all the families of Israel for sacrifices and for whole burnt offerings and for offerings of thanksgiving 16 to make atonement for you, saith the Lord God. And all the people shall give this oblation to the ruler of Israel; and by the ruler shall be given the whole burnt offerings and the sacrifices and the libations at the festivals and at the new moons and 17 on the sabbaths. At all the festivals of the house of Israel he
shall make the sin offerings and the sacrifices and the whole burnt offerings and the offerings of thanksgiving to make atonement for the house of Israel.

18 Thus saith the Lord God, In the first month on the first day of the month, you shall take from the herd a young bull without blemish, to make atonement for the sanctuary. And the priest shall take some of the blood of the atonement and put it on the door posts of the house and on the four corners of the temple and on the altar and on the posts of the gate of the inner court. And in like manner thou shalt do in the seventh month. On the first of that month thou shalt receive a portion from every individual and you shall make atonement for the house. And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of this month, shall be your paschal festival. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. And on that day the ruler shall offer, for himself and his house and for all the people of the land, a young bull for a sin offering. And during the seven days of the festival he shall offer as whole burnt offerings to the Lord, seven young bulls and seven rams without blemish, every day during the seven days; and for a sin offering, a kid of the goats every day with a sacrifice. And thou shalt prepare a cake for the bull and cakes for the rams, with a hin of oil to the cake.

25 And in the seventh month, on the fifteenth of the month, at that festival thou shalt do in like manner, during seven days, as well in regard to the sin offerings as to the whole burnt offerings and the cakes and the oil.

XLVI. Thus saith the Lord God, The gate of the inner court which faceth the east, shall be kept shut the six working days. On the day of the sabbaths it must be opened and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened. And the ruler shall go in by the way of the ailam of the gate on the inside and shall stand in the porch of the gate. And the priests shall prepare his whole burnt offerings and his offerings of thanksgiving; and he shall make his adoration in the porch of the gate and go out.

3 But the gate shall not be shut till evening. And the people of the land shall make their adorations on a range with the porch of this gate, both on the sabbath days and at the new moons,

4 before the Lord. And on the sabbath days the ruler shall offer to the Lord, for whole burnt offerings, six lambs without blem-
ish and a ram without blemish and a libation and cake for the ram; and for the lambs, a sacrifice, a free will offering with a hin of oil to every cake; and on the day of the new moon a young bull without blemish and six lambs and a ram which shall be without blemish; and there shall be a cake for the ram and a cake for the young bull with a libation, and for the lambs a voluntary gift and a hin of oil to every cake. And when the ruler cometh in he shall come in by the way of the ailam of the gate, but he shall go out by the way of the gate. And when the people of the land come in before the Lord at the festivals, he who cometh in at the north gate to worship, shall go out at the south gate: and he who cometh in at the south gate shall go out at the north gate. He shall not turn back to the gate at which he entered, but shall go out straight forward. And if the ruler is in the midst of them when they come in, he shall come in with them, and when they go out he shall go out. Both at the festivals and at the general assemblies there shall be a libation and cake for the young bull and a cake for the ram; and for the lambs a voluntary gift with a hin of oil for every cake. And if the ruler shall make a voluntary whole burnt offering of thanksgiving to the Lord, he may cause to be opened for himself the gate facing the east and make his whole burnt offering and his offerings of thanksgiving in the same manner as he doth on the day of the sabbaths. Then he shall go out, and after he is gone out he shall cause the gates to be shut.—Moreover he shall every day prepare a lamb of the first year without blemish for a whole burnt offering to the Lord. In the morning he shall prepare it; and every morning he shall prepare the libation for it, the sixth of the measure and the third of an hin of oil to mix up the offering of fine flour for the Lord. This is a standing order, you shall offer the lamb and its libation. And you shall offer the oil every morning. It is a continual whole burnt offering.

Thus saith the Lord God, If the ruler make a gift to one of his sons out of his inheritance, his sons shall hold it as an hereditary possession; but if he make a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of jubilee, and shall then revert to the ruler. None but his sons shall have an hereditary right. The ruler must not take any part of the people's
inheritance by oppression. Out of his own possessions he shall give an inheritance to his sons, that my people may not be driven every one from his possession.

19 Then he led me to the entrance of the passage behind the gate, leading to the chambers of the priests facing the north. And lo! here was a place set apart. And he said to me, This is the place where the priests are to boil the trespass offerings, and the sin offerings and where they are to bake all the offerings of flour, that they may not carry them out into the outer court, for fear of hallowing the people.

21 Then he led me to the outer court and conducted me round the four sides of the court. And lo! a court at the four corners of this court. At every corner a court; a court with four sides; and the little-court of this court was forty cubits long and thirty cubits broad. The four were of the same measure; and in them were chambers around the four. And under these chambers round about were kitchens. And he said to me, These are the houses of the cooks, where they who minister in the house are to boil the sacrifices of the people.

XLVII. Then he brought me to the vestibule of the house, and lo! water gushed out from under the porch eastward; for the front of the house faced the east; and the water ran down from the right corner, from the south, by the altar. And he led me out by the way of the north gate, and conducted me round on the outside to the gate facing the east; and lo! the water flowed down from the right corner, as a man cometh out. And having a measure in his hand, he measured a thousand with the measure, and waded across a purling stream.

4 Then he measured a thousand with the measure, and waded through water up to the thighs. Then he measured a thousand and waded through water up to the loins. Then he measured a thousand and could not cross it; for it was swelled to an impassable torrent. And he said to me, Hast thou seen, Son of man? Then he led and brought me back along the border of the river. And on my return, behold there were on the bank of the river, trees in great abundance on both sides. And he said to me, This water which is flowing out to the eastern part of Galilee, hath indeed gone down to Ara-
bia, and hath come to the sea to the water of the outlet, and it will heal the waters; so that every of the animals which breed in all the places whithersoever the stream cometh, shall live, and there shall be fish there in great abundance. Because this water is come there and healeth, therefore they shall live.—Every thing to which the stream cometh shall live. And fishermen shall there take a stand, from Engadin to Enagallim. There shall be a place for drying nets. The nets shall be of a peculiar kind; and the fishes thereof shall be like the fishes of the great sea; a very great multitude. But when it is forced from its channel and when it is turned from its course, and when it is caused to swell immoderately, the waters will not heal. They are turned into salt. And along the river there shall spring up on both banks, all sorts of trees fit for food. Their leaves shall never fade; nor shall their fruit ever fail. They shall always be in the act of producing fresh fruit, because the waters which nourish them flow down from the sanctuary. And their fruit shall be for food, and their leaves for medicine.

Thus saith the Lord God, These are the boundaries of the land, which you shall inherit. It is an allotted portion for the twelve tribes of Israel. And you shall inherit it, one as well as another. It is that for which I lifted up my hand that I would give it to their fathers; therefore this land shall fall to you for an inheritance, and these are the boundaries of the land—on the north from the great sea which cometh down and the bay of Emaseldam, Maabtheras, Ebrameliam between the borders of Damascus and the borders of Emathei, the court of Saunan, which are above the borders of Auranitis, these are the borders from the sea; from the court of Ainan the borders of Damascus. These are the northern boundaries. And with regard to the borders on the east between Lorantis and between Damascus and between Galaditis and the land of Israel, the Jordan is the boundary to the sea which is eastward in front of Phoenicon. These are the eastern boundaries. And on the south the boundaries are from Thaiman and Phoenicon to the water of Marimoth Kadem, thence to the great sea. This is the southern boundary. Thence a part of the great sea is the boundary to over against the bay of Emath even to the en-
trance thereof. These are the boundaries to the sea of Emath.
21 And you shall measure out this land for them to the tribes of Israel. You shall parcel it out by lot among you and the proselytes who dwell among you. Whoever have begotten sons among you shall be yours as natives among the children of Israel. With you they shall enjoy an inheritance among the tribes of Israel, but they shall be classed in the tribe of proselytes among the proselytes who are with you. There you shall give them an inheritance, saith the Lord God.

XLVIII. Now these are the names of the tribes beginning northward along the bay to the harbour of Emath, the court of Ailam, the border of Damascus northward, along part of Emath Aula; and they shall have from their eastern boundary to the sea one portion for Dan. And bordering on Dan from the eastern boundary to the sea a portion for Ascr. And bordering on Aser from the eastern boundary to the sea a portion for Nephthaleim; and bordering on Nephthaleim from the eastern boundary to the sea, a portion for Manasses; and bordering on Manasses from the eastern boundary to the sea, a portion for Ephraim; and bordering on Ephraim from the eastern boundary to the sea, a portion for Reuben; and bordering on Reuben from the eastern boundary to the sea, a portion for Juda; and bordering on Juda from the eastern boundary shall be the dedicated portion twenty five thousand cubits broad and the length like one of the portions from the eastern boundary to the sea, so the sanctuary shall be in the midst of them. The oblation which you shall set apart for the Lord shall be twenty five thousand cubits long and twenty five thousand broad. Out of these there shall be for the priests the holy dedication, on the north side twenty five thousand and on the west side ten thousand and on the south side twenty five thousand. And the mountain of the Holies shall be in the midst of it. To the priests, the consecrated sons of Sad-duk, who keep the watches of the house, who were not led astray in the apostasy of the children of Israel, as the Levites were, even to them this dedicated portion is given out of the dedicated portions of the land, as a Holy of Holies, apart from the Levites: and to the Levites shall be given, adjoining the borders of the priests, a portion twenty five thousand
cubits long and ten thousand broad; the whole being twenty five thousand in length and twenty thousand in breadth. No part of this shall be sold; nor shall it be parcelled out; nor shall the first fruits of this land be set apart; for it is dedicated to the Lord. And with regard to the overplus twenty five thousand in length and five thousand broad, out of it there shall be a plot for the city, for building and for the open walk around it. Now the city shall be in the middle of it, and these shall be its dimensions—on the north, four thousand five hundred cubits; and on the south, four thousand five hundred; and on the east, four thousand five hundred; and on the west, four thousand five hundred. And the open walk for the city shall be on the north, two hundred and fifty, and on the south, two hundred and fifty, and on the east, two hundred and fifty, and on the west, two hundred and fifty. And the residue of the length adjoining the holy dedication, ten thousand on the east and ten thousand on the west side shall be dedicated portions, and they who occupy the city shall have the products thereof for bread. It may be worked by any out of all the tribes of Israel who occupy the city. The whole oblation twenty five thousand by twenty five thousand shall be a square. From it you shall set apart the oblation for the sanctuary bordering on the possession of the city. And the residue on the one side and the other shall be for the ruler, bordering on the holy dedications and along the possession of the city for twenty five thousand in length, and thence to the eastern boundary and westward by twenty five thousand to the western boundary. Adjoining these portions of the ruler shall be the holy oblation. And the dedication appropriate to the house shall be in the middle of it and taken from the Levites, and shall border on the possession of the city which is in the middle between the ruler's portions. And it shall be between the borders of Juda and the borders of Benjamin and the portions of the ruler. And with respect to the rest of the tribes, there shall be from the eastern boundary to the sea, a portion for Benjamin: and bordering on Benjamin from the eastern boundary to the sea, a portion for Symeon: and bordering on Symeon, from the eastern boundary to the sea, a portion for Issachar: and bordering on Issachar from the eastern boundary to the sea, a portion for
27 Zabulon: and bordering upon Zabulon from the eastern boundary to the sea, a portion for Gad: and the borders of
28 Gad shall be from the eastern boundary and on the south along by the border of Thaiman and the water of Baremoth
29 Kades included in his possession, to the great sea. This is the land which you shall parcel out by lot among the tribes of Israel: and these are their portions, saith the Lord God.
30 Moreover these shall be the streets of the city, those
31 running northward four thousand five hundred cubits; and the gates of the city shall be named after the tribes of Israel, three gates facing the north, one gate Reuben, one gate Juda and
32 one gate Levi; and those running eastward four thousand five hundred cubits, with three gates, one gate Joseph and one
33 gate Benjamin and one gate Dan: and those running southward, four thousand five hundred cubits with three gates, one
34 gate Symeon and one gate Issachar and one gate Zabulon; and those running westward four thousand five hundred cubits with three gates, one gate Gad, and one gate Aser and one gate Nephthaleim. The circumference eighteen thousand. And the name of the city from the day it is built shall be the name it now hath.

DANIEL.

I. IN the third year of the reign of Joakim king of Juda, Nabuchodonosar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and be-
2 sieged it. And the Lord delivered into his hand Joakim king of Juda and a part of the vessels of the house of God, which he carried to the land of Sennaar to the house of his god: and having deposited the vessels in the treasure house of his god,
3 the king ordered Asphanez his high chamberlain to bring in of the children of the captivity of Israel, namely, of the seed royal and of the nobility, some youths who had no blemish, and who were of a good countenance, studious of every science, improved in knowledge and understanding and qualified to stand in the house before the king; and to instruct them
5 in the learning and language of the Chaldeans. And the king ordered them a daily allowance from the king's table, and of the wine for his own drinking; and that they should be dieted for three years and after that stand before the king.
Now there were among them of the children of Juda, Daniel and Ananias and Azarias and Misael; and the high chamberlain gave them names, to Daniel, Baltasar; and to Ananias, Sedrach; and to Misael, Misach; and to Azarias, Abdenago.

And Daniel having resolved not to pollute himself with the table of the king nor with the wine which he drank, intreated the chamberlain that he might not be defiled. Now God had brought Daniel into favour and compassion with the high chamberlain, therefore the chamberlain said to Daniel, I am afraid of my lord the king who hath appointed your meat and your drink. Perhaps he may see your countenance more uncomely than the youths of your age, and you may endanger my head with the king. Thereupon Daniel said to Amelsad, whom the high chamberlain had set over Daniel, Ananias, Misael and Azarias, Try thy servants, we pray thee, ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink; and let our countenances and the countenances of the youths who eat of the king's table be examined in thy presence; and, as thou seest, deal with thy servants. So he hearkened to them and tried them ten days. And at the end of the ten days their countenances appeared more comely and their flesh firmer than that of the youths, who had eaten of the king's table; whereupon Amelsad took away the food and the wine for their drink and gave them vegetables. And as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and understanding in all literature and science; and Daniel was skilled in all visions and dreams. And at the end of the years which the king had appointed for introducing them, the high chamberlain brought them in before Nabuchodonosar. And the king conversed with them. And among them all there were none found equal to Daniel and Ananias and Misael and Azarias. So they stood before the king. And in every subject of wisdom and science on which the king questioned them he found them ten times more skilled than all the soothsayers and the magians who were in the realm. And Daniel continued to the first year of Cyrus the king.

Nabuchodonosar, in the second year of his reign, dreamed a dream and his spirit was troubled and his sleep went from
2 him. And the king gave orders to call the soothsayers and the magians and the chymists and the Chaldees that they might tell the king his dream. And when they were come and stood before the king, the king said to them, I have dreamed and my mind is anxious to know the dream. Whereupon the Chaldees said to the king in Syriac, O king, live forever. Tell thy servants the dream and we will explain the meaning. The king answered the Chaldees, The subject is gone from me. If you do not tell me the dream and the interpretation you shall be put to death and your houses shall be exposed to plunder. But if you let me know the dream and the interpretation, you shall receive of me gifts and immunities and great honour. At all events, tell me the dream and the meaning of it. They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream and we will explain the meaning. In reply to which the king said, I know of a truth that you want to gain time, as you see the matter is gone from me. If therefore you do not tell me the dream, I take it for granted that you have agreed upon something false and fictitious to be said before me, until the time elapse. Tell me my dream, then I will know that you can tell me the meaning of it. The Chaldees answered in the presence of the king and said, There is not a man on the earth who can make known what the king requireth; nor doth any king or ruler, however great, ask such a thing, of any soothsayer, magian or Chaldee. For the thing which the king requireth is so difficult, that there is none who can lay it before the king, but the gods only, whose dwelling is not with flesh. Upon this the king in furious wrath gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. So the decree went forth. And when the wise men began to be slain— (Now search had been made for Daniel and his friends to slay them and Daniel had then addressed Arioch, the king's marshal, who was going out to slay the wise men of Babylon, touching the counsel and decree, "Why, O chief of the king, hath this horrid sentence gone forth from the king's presence?" And when Arioch informed Daniel of the matter, Daniel had intreated the king to grant him time and he would tell the king the meaning of it; and Daniel had gone to his house and acquainted his friends Ananias, Misael and Azarias with the affair; and they had sought mercy of the God of heaven touch-
ing this secret, that Daniel and his friends might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon: and the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night; whereupon he blessed the God of heaven, and said, "Blessed be the name of God from everlasting to everlasting; for wisdom and knowledge are his; and he changeth times and seasons. He setteth up kings and removeth them. He giveth wisdom to the wise and understanding to them who have knowledge. He it is who revealeth deep and hidden things. He knoweth the things which are in darkness. And with him is the light. To thee, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise; because thou hast given me wisdom and power and hast made known to me what we asked thee and hast revealed to me the vision of the king:)

Then Daniel went to Arioch whom the king had appointed to slay the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; but introduce me to the king, and I will tell him the meaning. Thereupon Arioch with haste introduced Daniel to the presence of the king and said to him, I have found among the captives of Israel, a man who can tell the king the interpretation. And the king addressing Daniel, whose name was Baltasar, said, Canst thou tell me the dream which I saw, and the meaning of it? And Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said, The secret which the king demandeth, it is not in the power of wise men, magians, sooth sayers, gazarenes, to tell the king. There is none but God in heaven who revealeth secrets. He indeed hath made known to the king Nabuchodonosar what must come to pass in latter days. With regard to thy dream, and the visions of thy head, on thy bed, this is it. Thy thoughts, O king, on thy bed ascended to what might come to pass hereafter. And he who revealeth secrets made known to thee the things which must come to pass. And to me this secret was revealed, not indeed for any wisdom in me above all the living: but for the purpose of making the interpretation known to the king, that thou mayst know the thoughts of thy heart.

Thou, O king! didst behold, and lo! an image! Great was that image and its aspect lofty as it stood before thee; and its appearance was awful. It was an image, the head of which
was of pure gold; the hands and the breast and the arms of it were of silver; the belly and the thighs of brass: the legs of iron; the feet partly of iron, and partly of potter's clay.—With wonder thou didst view it, till from a mountain there was rent without hands a stone, which smote the image on the feet, which were of iron and potters clay, and at last broke them to pieces. Then were broken to pieces at once, the clay, the iron, the brass, the silver, the gold. And they became like the dust of a threshing floor in summer: and a great wind swept them away, and there was no place found for them. And the stone which smote the image became a great mountain and filled all the earth. This is the dream. The meaning of it we will now explain to the king. Thou O king, art a king of kings, to whom the God of heaven hath given a kingdom, strong and mighty and glorious, in every place where the sons of men dwell. Into thy hand he hath delivered the beasts of the field, and the birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, and appointed thee lord over all. Thou art the head of gold. And after thee there shall be raised up another kingdom inferior to thee; then a third kingdom which is the brass, which shall rule over the whole earth; then a fourth kingdom which shall be strong as iron. As iron breaketh to pieces and subdueth all things, so shall it break and subdue all. And inasmuch as thou sawest the feet and toes, partly of clay and partly of iron, it shall be a disjointed kingdom, though there shall be in it some of its iron root. As thou sawest the iron mixed with the clay; and the toes of the feet were part iron, and part clay, some part of that kingdom will be strong and some part of it will be broken. Inasmuch as thou sawest the iron mingled with the clay, there will be mixtures in it, of the seed of men, and they will not cement one with another, as iron doth not cement with clay. And in the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and this kingdom of his shall not be left to another people. It shall break in pieces, and blow away all those kingdoms and shall itself stand forever. As thou sawest that without hands there was cut from a mountain a stone, which broke in pieces the clay, the iron, the brass, the silver, the gold; the God who is great, hath made known to the king
what must come to pass hereafter. The dream indeed is true and the interpretation thereof is faithful.

46 Then king Nabuchodonosar fell on his face, and made obeisance to Daniel and ordered holy gifts, and sweet odours to be offered to him. And the king answered and said to Daniel, Of a truth, your God is the God of Gods, and the Lord of kings, the revealer of secrets; since thou hast been enabled to reveal this secret. Then the king raised Daniel to high rank and gave him many great gifts, and set him over the whole region of Babylon, and a chief satrap over all the wise men of Babylon. And Daniel requested of the king, and he set Sedrach, Misach and Abdenago, over the works of the region of Babylon. And Daniel was in the court of the king.

III. In the eighteenth year of Nabuchodonosar, the king made an image of gold; the height of it was sixty cubits, and its breadth six cubits. And having set it up in the plain of Deeria, in the province of Babylon, he sent for the presidents and the generals, and the governors, rulers and princes, and those in authority, and all the chiefs of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nabuchodonosar the king had set up. And when the governors, the presidents, the generals, the leaders, the great princes, those in authority, and all the chiefs of the provinces were assembled for the dedication of the image which Nabuchodonosar the king had set up, and were standing before the image, the herald cried with a loud voice, To you peoples of different tribes and languages command is given; whenever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet and syrinx and of the kithara and sambuk and of the psaltery, and all kinds of musical instruments, prostrate yourselves and worship the golden image which Nabuchodonosar the king hath set up. And whoever will not prostrate himself and worship, shall that very hour be cast into that furnace of fire, which is heating.

7 So when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and syrinx, and of the kithara and sambuk, and of the psaltery, and all kinds of musical instruments, all the peoples, tribes and languages, falling prostrate, worshipped the golden image which Nabuchodonosar the king had set up. Then came certain Chaldeans, and stated to the king an accusation against the
9 Jews, "O king, live forever! thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man who shall hear the sound of the trumpet and syrinx and of the kithara and sambuk, and of the psaltery and all kinds of musical instruments; and who will not prostrate himself and worship the golden image, shall be cast into that furnace of fire which is heated. Now there are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the works of the province of Babylon, namely, Sedrach, Misach, Abdenago, who have not hearkened, O king, to thy decree. They neither serve thy gods, nor do they worship the golden image which thou hast set up."

13 Upon this Nabuchodonosar in wrath and fury commanded to bring Sedrach, Misach, Abdenago: and when they were brought before the king, Nabuchodonosar addressed them, saying, Is it true, Sedrach, Misach, Abdenago, that you do not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? Now therefore are you ready, when you hear the sound of the trumpet and syrinx and of the kithara and sambuk and of the psaltery and symphony and all kinds of musical instruments, to fall prostrate and worship the golden image which I have made? For if you do not worship you shall, that very hour, be cast into the furnace of fire, which is heated.

16 And what god is there who can deliver you out of my hands? In reply to this, Sedrach, Misach, Abdenago said to the king Nabuchodonosar, We are at no loss to answer thee in respect to this matter. For our God in heaven, whom we worship, is able to deliver us out of the furnace of fire which is heated, and he will deliver us, O king, out of thy hands. But even though he do not, be it known to thee, O king, that we cannot serve thy gods, nor will we worship the image which thou hast set up. At this Nabuchodonosar was filled with wrath, and the form of his countenance was changed against Sedrach, Misach and Abdenago. And he ordered to heat the furnace seven fold, till it was hot as possible: and commanded some strong men to bind Sedrach, Misach and Abdenago, and cast them into the furnace of fire which was heated. Then were these men bound, clad as they were with their Babylonish dress and with turbans and boots; and cast into the midst of the furnace of fire which was heated, as the command of the king was peremptory. But though the furnace was heated to an excessive
degree and these three men, Sedrach, Misach and Abdenago fell bound into the midst of the glowing furnace, yet they walked about in the midst of the flame, praising God and blessing the Lord. When Nabuchodonosar heard them singing praise he was amazed and starting up hastily said to his nobles, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? And when they said to the king, True, O king, the king said, Here I see four men loose and walking about in the midst of the fire unhurt: And the appearance of the fourth is like a son of a god. Then Nabuchodonosar went near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and said, Sedrach, Misach, Abdenago, ye servants of the Most High God, come out and come hither. Upon which Sedrach, Misach and Abdenago came forth out of the midst of the fire. And the satraps and the generals and the governors and the mighty men of the king gathered round and viewed the men with astonishment; for the fire had not had any power over their body. Even the hair of their heads was not singed, nor were their mantles changed, nor a smell of fire on them. Then Nabuchodonosar the king addressing them, said, "Blessed be the God of Sedrach, Misach, Abdenago, who hath sent his angel and delivered his servants. Because they have trusted in him and have altered the king's decree and delivered up their bodies to fire that they might not serve nor worship any god, but only their own God, therefore I issue this decree, 'Every people, tribe, language, which shall utter any reproach against the God of Sedrach, Misach, Abdenago, shall be devoted to destruction and their houses to plunder: for there is no other god who can deliver in this manner.'"

Then the king reinstated Sedrach, Misach and Abdenago in the province of Babylon, and advanced them in dignity and honoured them with a command over all the Jews in his realm.

IV. NABUCHODONOSAR the king, to all the peoples, tribes and languages who dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.

It hath seemed good in my sight to declare to you the signs and the wonders which the God who is Most High hath done with me. How great and mighty is his kingdom. His king-
dom is an everlasting kingdom; and his dominion is to endless ages.

4 I Nabuchodonosar was at rest in my house and in the enjoyment of prosperity. I had a dream which terrified me and I was troubled on my bed, and the visions of my head disquieted me. Therefore I issued a decree to bring before me all the wise men of Babylon, that they might explain to me the meaning of this dream. And when the soothsayers, the magians, the gazarenes, the Chaldees came in, I told my dream before them; but they did not explain to me the meaning of it until Daniel came, whose name is Baltasar, after the name of my God, and who hath in him a holy spirit of a God. To him I said, Baltasar chief of the soothsayers, who, I know, hast a holy spirit of a god in thee, so that no secret can escape thee, hear the vision of the dream which I have seen; and tell me the meaning of it. I beheld with astonishment on my bed, and lo! a tree in the midst of the earth. Though its height was great, the tree increased in magnitude and strength and its top reached up to heaven; and its bulk to the extent of the whole earth. Its leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant. And on it there was food for all: and the wild beasts of the field dwelt beneath it; and the birds of the air lodged among its branches; and from it all flesh was fed. I beheld in a vision of the night on my bed; and lo an Eir, even a holy one, came down from heaven and cried with a loud voice, and thus he said, "Cut down that tree and lop off its branches and shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts be driven from underneath it and the birds from its branches. But leave the stump of its roots in the earth; and in a band of iron and brass and in the green grass abroad and in the dew of heaven let it abide: and let its portion be with the wild beasts in the grass of the earth. His heart shall be changed from men and the heart of a wild beast shall be given him and seven seasons shall revolve over him. The sentence is by the decree of an Eir; and the decree is a request of holy ones, that the living may know that there is a sovereign Lord of the kingdom of men and that he can give it to whom he will, and set over it that which is disesteemed by men." This is the dream, which I Nabuchodonosar the king have seen. Thou therefore Baltasar, tell me the meaning; for
all the wise men of my kingdom are unable to explain to me the meaning of it: but thou Daniel art able, because there is in thee the holy spirit of a god.

19 Upon this Daniel, whose name is Baltasar, was absorpt in astonishment for about an hour and his thoughts agitated him and Baltasar answered and said, Let this dream, my Lord, be for them who hate thee, and the interpretation thereof for thine enemies. The tree which thou sawest, which was increased in magnitude and strength, the top of which reached up to heaven and its bulk to the extent of the whole earth, the leaves of which were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and on which there was food for all; beneath which the beasts of the field dwelt, and on the branches of which the birds of the air roosted: Thou, O king art it. For thou art become great and strong and thy greatness hath increased and reached up to heaven and thy dominion to the limits of the earth. And inasmuch as the king saw an Eir, even a holy one descending from heaven who said, Cut down that tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth; and in a band of iron and brass and in the green grass abroad and in the dew of heaven let it abide; and let its portion be with the wild beasts of the field until seven seasons revolve over it—This, O king, is the interpretation thereof and the decree of the Most High which is about to come upon my lord the king. Thou wilt be driven from among men; and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; and they will feed thee with grass like an ox; and thou shalt lodge in the dew of heaven; and seven seasons shall revolve over thee, till thou be made sensible that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men and can give it to whom he will. But inasmuch as they said, Let the stump of the roots of the tree remain, thy kingdom shall remain for thee when thou art made sensible of the heavenly authority. For this cause, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee; and make atonement for thy sins by acts of kindness, and for thy transgressions by tender mercies for the distressed. Perhaps God may forgive thine offences.

28 All these things came upon Nabuchodonosar the king. At the end of twelve months, as the king was walking in the temple of his kingdom at Babylon, he spake, saying, Is not this the
great Babylon which I have built for the house of a kingdom, by the might of my power, for the display of my glory? While the word was yet in the king's mouth, there came a voice from heaven, To thee Nabuchodonosar it is said, the regal power is gone from thee and thou shalt be driven from among men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; and they shall feed thee with grass like an ox; and seven seasons shall revolve over thee, that thou mayst know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men and can give it to whom he will. In that very hour the word was fulfilled on Nabuchodonosar; and he was driven from among men and ate grass like an ox and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, until his hair grew strong like the shag of lions and his nails like the claws of birds. And at the end of the days I Nabuchodonosar lifted up mine eyes to heaven, and mine understanding was restored to me, and I blessed the Most High and praised and glorified him who liveth forever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is to endless generations, and all the inhabitants of the earth are reckoned as nothing; and he doth according to his pleasure in the army of heaven and in the habitations of the earth; and there is none who can stay his hand, or say to him, What hast thou done. At this very hour my senses were restored to me and I reassumed the honour of my kingdom; and my form returned to me; and my princes and my grandees sought me; and I was re-established in my kingdom and greater majesty was added to me. Now therefore I Nabuchodonosar praise and extol and glorify the king of heaven; for all his works are true and his ways are judgments and all them who walk in pride he can abase.

V. KING Baltasar made a great supper for his thousand grandees and wine was set before the thousand. And as he was drinking, Baltasar gave an order upon tasting the wine, to bring the vessels of gold and silver which Nabuchodonosar his father had brought out of the temple at Jerusalem; and that the king and his nobles, and his concubines and his wives should drink out of them. Accordingly the vessels of gold and silver which had been taken out of the temple of God at Jerusalem were brought, and the king and his nobles and his concubines
4 and his wives drank out of them. And having drunk wine they praised the gods of gold and silver and brass and wood and stone. At that very hour there came forth fingers of a man's hand and wrote over against the lamp, on the plaistering of the wall of the king's palace. And the king beheld with astonishment the joint of the hand that was writing. Whereupon the king's countenance changed and his thoughts troubled him and the joints of his loins were loosened and his knees smote one against another. And the king cried aloud to bring in the magians, Chaldees, gazarenes. And he said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing and explain to me the meaning, he shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold for his neck and shall be a chief, third in rank, in my kingdom. And when all the king's wise men came in and could neither read the writing nor explain the meaning to the king, king Baltasar was agitated and his countenance changed, and his nobles were in like trepidation. Then the queen came to the banquet house and said, O king, live forever! Let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor thy countenance change. There is in thy kingdom a man, in whom is a spirit of a god, and in the days of thy father, light and knowledge were found in him, and the king Nabuchodonosar thy father appointed him chief of the soothsayers, Chaldees, gazarenes, because of the extraordinary spirit in him, and of his understanding and knowledge in the interpretation of dreams, and explaining hard sentences and solving difficulties—namely Daniel whom the king surnamed Baltasar. Now therefore let him be called in and he will tell thee the meaning of this. Thereupon Daniel was brought in before the king. And the king said to Daniel, Thou art Daniel? One of the captives of Juda whom the king my father brought hither? I have heard of thee that there is in thee a spirit of a god, and that light and knowledge and extraordinary wisdom have been found in thee. Now the wise men, magians, gazarenes have come in before me to read that writing and make known to me the meaning of it, but they are not able to tell me. But I have heard of thee that thou canst solve difficulties. Now therefore if thou canst read that writing and explain to me the meaning of it, thou shalt be clothed in purple and have a chain of gold for thy neck and be a chief, third
17 in rank, in my kingdom. Then Daniel said before the king, Let thy gifts be thine own, and give to another the honour of thy household; but the writing I will read, and I will explain to thee the meaning of it. O king, God, the Most High gave to Nabuchodonosar thy father this kingdom and majesty and glory and honour. And because of the majesty which he gave him, all the peoples, tribes and languages trembled and were struck with awe at his presence. Whom he would he slew, and whom he would he smote, and whom he would he set up, and whom he would he put down. But when his heart became elated and his spirit emboldened to shew its arrogance, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom and his glory was taken from him; and he was driven from among men; and his heart was disposed to associate with the beasts; and his dwelling was with the wild asses; and he was fed with grass like an ox; and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, till he was made to know that the Most High God ruleth over the kingdom of men and can give it to whom he will.

22 Now thou, Baltasar, his son, hast not therefore humbled thy heart before this God. Hast thou not known all these things? Yet thou hast exalted thyself against the Lord God of heaven. And the vessels of his house have been brought before thee, and thou and thy nobles and thy concubines and thy wives have drunk wine out of them, and thou hast praised the gods of gold and silver and brass and iron and wood and stone which neither see nor hear, nor understand: but the God in whose hand is thy breath and all thy ways—him thou hast not glorified. For this cause a joint of a hand hath been sent from his presence, and it hath sketched this writing. Now this is what is written, Mane, Thekel, Phares. The interpretation of the decree is this. Mane; God hath measured thy kingdom and brought it to a conclusion. Thekel—It hath been weighed in a balance and found wanting. Phares—Thy kingdom is taken away and given to Medes and Persians.

29 Then Baltasar gave orders and they clothed Daniel with purple and put a chain of gold about his neck, and proclamation was made concerning him that he was a chief, third in rank, in the kingdom. And that very night Baltasar the Chal-
dean king was slain, and Darius the Mede assumed the kingdom, being sixty two years of age.

VI. IT having seemed good in the sight of Darius, he set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps to be governors of provinces throughout his whole dominion; and over these he appointed three ministers of whom Daniel was one; that the governors might render an account to them, so that the king might not be oppressed with business. And Daniel was at the head of these. Because there was in him an extraordinary spirit and the king had set him over his whole kingdom, therefore the ministers and the governors sought to find some pretext against Daniel. And when they found no pretext, lapse or crime with which to charge him, for he was faithful; the ministers said, We shall not find any pretext against Daniel except in the ceremonies relating to his God. Then the ministers and the governors waited on the king, and said to him, King Darius live forever! All that are over thy kingdom, the generals and governors, the chief commanders and toparchs have joined in opinion to establish by a royal statute and make a firm decree, that whoever shall make any request of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee only, O king; he shall be cast into the den of the lions. Now therefore, O king, establish the edict and promulgate it in writing, that the decree of the Persians and Medes may not be dispensed with. Upon this Darius the king ordered the decree to be written.

Now when Daniel knew that the decree was passed, he went home and the windows in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem were opened for him, and three times a day, kneeling down on his knees, he prayed and gave thanks before his God as he had done heretofore.

Now those men watched and having found Daniel praising and supplicating his God, they went and said to the king, O king, hast thou not passed an edict, that every man who shall make any request of any god or man for the space of thirty days save of thee only, O king, shall be cast into the den of the lions? And the king said, It is true; and the decree of the Medes and Persians cannot be altered. Then they answered and said before the king, Daniel, who is one of the
captives from Juda, hath not paid obedience to thy decree.

14 For three times a day he maketh requests of his God. When the king heard this matter he was exceedingly grieved for it and strove hard for Daniel to save him and continued till evening

15 his endeavours to deliver him. Then the men said to the king, Know, O king, that it is decreed by the Medes and Persians, That no edict or statute which the king shall pass must be dispensed with. Then the king gave orders and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions' den. And the king said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually will himself deliver thee. And when they had brought a stone and put it on the mouth of the den, the king caused it to be sealed with his own signet and with the signet of his nobles that nothing might be altered in respect to Daniel. Then the king went to his house and retired to bed without supper. And there was no food brought to him and sleep went from him. But God shut the mouths of the lions so that they did not molest Daniel. And in the morning the king arose soon as it was light and went in haste to the lions' den. And when he approached the den, he cried with a loud voice, O Daniel, the servant of the living God, hath thy God, whom thou servest continually, been able to deliver thee from the mouths of the lions? Thereupon Daniel said to the king, O king live forever! My God sent his angel and shut the mouths of the lions and they have not hurt me. For before him rectitude was found in me; and even in thy sight, O king, I have committed no offence. At this the king was exceedingly rejoiced and gave order to take Daniel up out of the den. So he was taken up out of the den and there was no manner of hurt found on him, because he had trusted in his God. Then the king commanded and they brought the men who had accused Daniel, and they and their sons and their wives were cast into the den of the lions. And before they reached the bottom of the den the lions had such mastery over them that they broke all their bones. Then Darius the king wrote—To all the peoples, tribes and languages who dwell in the whole earth, Peace be multiplied to you. From my presence this decree is established, that in every government of my kingdom men tremble and be struck with awe at the presence of the God of Daniel; for he
is the living God and endureth forever, and his kingdom can never be destroyed and his dominion will be to the end.
27 He supporteth and delivereth and doth signs and wonders in heaven and on earth. He it is who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
28 So Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

VII. In the first year of Baltasar king of the Chaldeans, Daniel had a dream and these were the visions of his head on his bed and he wrote down this dream of his.
2 I Daniel beheld, and lo! the four winds of heaven blew
3 violently on the great sea; and four great beasts came up out
4 of the sea, different one from the other. The first was like a lioness, and had wings like those of an eagle. I beheld till her wings were plucked off; and she was raised from the earth and stood on the feet of a man and a man's heart was given her.
5 And behold the second beast was like a bear; and it stood half erect and there were three ribs in its mouth between its teeth,
6 and they said to it thus, "Arise, devour much flesh." After this I looked, and lo! another beast like a leopard; and it had four wings of a bird on it; and this beast had four heads and
7 to it dominion was given. After this I beheld, and lo! a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, exceedingly strong and its teeth of iron! It devoured and brake in pieces! and the residue it trampled with its feet. Now this was far different from all the
8 beasts which were before it and it had ten horns. I attended to its horns, and behold another little horn sprouted up in the midst of them; and three of the horns which were before it were rooted out from before it. And behold in this horn there were eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking
9 great things. And I beheld till the thrones were set and an ancient of days was seated. And his garment was white as
10 snow and the hair of his head was like pure wool. His throne was a flame of fire and his wheels a blazing fire. A river of fire rolled before him. Thousands of thousands ministered to him
11 and myriads of myriads waited on him. The court sat and books were opened. I looked then because of the sound of the great words which that horn had spoken, until the beast
was slain and destroyed and its body given to be burned with fire. And the government of the rest of the beasts was changed and a length of time given them until a time and a time. And I beheld in the vision of the night, and lo! with the clouds of heaven one like a son of man coming! And he advanced to the Ancient of days and was introduced to him. And to him was given the government and the honour and the kingdom; and all the peoples, tribes and languages are to serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall never pass away, and his kingdom shall not be destroyed.

As for me, Daniel, my spirit quivered in my whole frame and the vision of my head troubled me. And I went to one of them in waiting and made diligent inquiry to learn of him concerning all these things and he gave me exact information and explained to me the meaning of these things.

These beasts, which are four, denote that four kingdoms shall be raised up on the earth. These shall be removed, and the holy ones of the Most High shall take the kingdom and hold it to an age of the ages.

Then I inquired particularly concerning the fourth beast, because it was different from every beast, exceedingly dreadful. Its teeth were of iron and its claws of brass. It devoured and brake in pieces and the residue it trampled with its feet. And concerning the ten horns, which were on its head, and that other, which sprouted up and shook off some of the first; and which had eyes and a mouth speaking great things and the appearance of which was greater than the rest, I beheld and that horn made war on the holy ones and prevailed against them until the Ancient of days came and gave judgment for the holy ones of the Most High, and the time came and the holy ones possessed the kingdom. And he said, With regard to the fourth beast, there shall be a fourth kingdom on the earth which shall surpass all the kingdoms and devour all the earth and trample down and cut to pieces. And its ten horns denote that ten kingdoms shall be raised up; and after them another shall be raised up which shall exceed in evils all those before and shall humble three kings and shall speak words against the Most High and wear out the holy ones of the Most High and think of changing times and law, and
this shall be put in its power for a time and times and the half of a time. When the court hath sat they will change this government to abolish and destroy it utterly. For the kingdom and the dominion and the majesty of the kings who are under the whole heaven, is given to the holy ones of the Most High. And his kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all the governments shall serve and obey him. To this is the end of this word.

As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me much and my countenance was changed. But I kept the matter in mine own heart.

IN the third year of Baltasar the king a vision appeared to me. After the first vision which appeared to me, I Daniel was at Susoi the palace which is in the province of Ailam; and being on the bank of the Oubal, I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and lo a ram stood before the Oubal and it had lofty horns and one was higher than the other; and the highest sprang up last. And I saw the ram butting westward and northward and southward, and of all the beasts none could stand before him nor was there any to deliver out of his hand. So he acted according to his pleasure and became great. And while I was considering, behold a he-goat came from the south west over the face of the whole earth and he did not seem to touch the ground. And the goat had a horn between his eyes. And he came to the ram which had two horns and which I saw standing before the Oubal and ran up to him with all his might. I saw him indeed coming up to the ram and he was exasperated against him, and he smote the ram and broke his two horns and the ram had not power to stand before him. So he threw him on the ground and trampled him, and there was none to deliver the ram out of his hand. And the goat of the goats became very great and when he was in full strength, that great horn of his was broken; and four others sprang up from under it towards the four winds of heaven. And out from the first of them there came forth one strong horn which became very great towards the south and towards the host, and its greatness reached even to the host of heaven. And there fell on the earth some of the host of heaven and
11 some of the stars, and these were trodden down. And until the captain general should deliver the captivity, even by reason of him the sacrifice was disturbed; and he was prospered; and the sanctuary is to be desolated; and sin was permitted against the sacrifice; and this righteousness was cast on the ground; so he acted and was prospered. And I heard a holy one speaking; and a holy one said to the Phelmoni who spoke, "How long shall this vision last, respecting the sacrifice which is taken away, and the sin of desolation which is permitted; and the sanctuary and the host be trodden down?" And he said to him, Even till there shall be of an evening and a morning two thousand four hundred days. Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.

15 And when I Daniel had seen the vision and sought the meaning, then lo! there stood before me an appearance like that of a man. And I heard a voice of a man amidst the Oubal and it called and said, "Gabriel, instruct him respecting the vision." So he came and stood near where I was standing. And when he came, I was struck with terror and fell on my face. And he said to me, Son of man, understand; for this vision also is for the end of a time. And while he was speaking to me, I fell flat with my face on the ground. Then he touched me and set me on my feet, and said, Behold I make known to thee the things which shall be in the last days of the indignation; for this vision also is for the end of a time. The ram which thou sawest which had the horns, is the king of the Medes and Persians. The goat of the goats, is the king of the Grecians; and the great horn which was between his eyes is the first king. Now as upon this being broken, four horns shot up from under it, four kings of that nation of his will be raised up, but not by their own might. And in the last days of their kingdom, their sins being come to the full, a king will be raised up of an unblushing countenance, skilled in problems, and his power will be great, and he will destroy things which are objects of admiration and will prosper and act and destroy mighty men, and a holy people. And the yoke of his chain will prosper; and by his hand and by his heart, deceit will be magnified, and with deceit he will destroy many and for the destruction of many he will be raised up and will
26 break them like eggs with his hands. Now the vision of the evening and the morning, which was mentioned is true. Seal thou therefore the vision, for it is for many days.

27 Upon this I Daniel was confined to my bed and sick.—And when I arose I did the king's business. And I was astonished at the vision; but none understood it.

IX. IN the first year of Darius, the son of Assuerus of the seed of the Medes, who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans, I Daniel understood by the books that the number of the years, which was a word of the Lord to Jeremias the prophet, for the accomplishment of the desolation of Jerusalem, was seventy years. Therefore I turned my face to the Lord my God, to seek a prayer and supplication by fasting and sackcloth. And I prayed to the Lord my God and made confession and said, O Lord, the God great and marvellous, who keepest thy covenant and thy mercy for them who love thee and keep thy commandments! We have sinned; we have committed iniquity; we have transgressed and apostatised and turned away from thy commandments, and from thy judgments, and have not hearkened to thy servants the prophets who spoke in thy name to our kings and our chiefs and our fathers and to all the people of the land. To thee, O Lord, belongeth righteousness; but to us confusion of face as at this day—to the man Juda and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to all Israel—and to those near and to them far off, in every land where thou hast scattered them for their breach of covenant of which they have been guilty. In thee, O Lord, is our righteousness. Though to us belongeth confusion of face—to our kings, and our chiefs and our fathers, who have sinned against thee; with the Lord our God are tender mercies and forgivenesses. Because we apostatised and did not hearken to the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws which he set before us by the ministry of his servants the prophets; and all Israel transgressed thy law, and declined to hearken to thy voice; therefore upon us came the curse and the execration which is written in the law of Moses the servant of God. Because we sinned against him, therefore he confirmed his words which he spoke against us and against our judges who
judged us, by bringing upon us great evils, such as never happened under the whole heaven; as was the case in Jerusalem. According to what is written in the law of Moses all those evils have come upon us. We indeed did not supplicate the favour of the Lord our God, by turning from all our wickedness, therefore that we might be made sensible of all thy truth, the Lord hath indeed been watchful and hath brought upon us these things. For the Lord our God is righteous in every act of his which he hath done, and we have not hearkened to his voice.

Now, O Lord our God, who broughtest thy people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand and who hast made thyself a great name as at this day; we have sinned, we have committed iniquity. Mercy, O Lord, is thine in all things; let thy wrath, I beseech thee, be turned away and thine indignation from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain. Because we have sinned, therefore for our iniquities and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become an object of reproach among all those around us. But now, O Lord our God, hearken to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplications; and let thy face shine upon thy sanctuary which is desolate. For thine own sake, O Lord, incline, O my God, thine ear and hear. Open thine eyes and behold our desolation and that of thy city which is called by thy name. For we do not for our own righteousness present our piteous case before thee; but we cast ourselves upon thy tender mercies, O Lord, which are many. O Lord hear! O Lord, be appeased! Attend, O Lord! Defer not, O my God, for thine own sake! for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.

Now whilst I was still speaking and praying and confessing mine own sins and the sins of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the mount of the sanctuary; even whilst I was uttering this prayer, behold a man, Gabriel, whom I saw in the former vision, came flying and touched me about the hour of the evening sacrifice and instructed me and conversed with me and said, Daniel, I am now come to teach thee knowledge. At the beginning of thy supplication a word went forth, and I am come to tell thee; for thou art a man greatly beloved. Be instructed therefore by
24 the decree, and understand by the vision. Seventy weeks are set apart for thy people and for the holy city; for finishing sin offerings, and for sealing up sin offerings; and blotting out iniquities, and making atonement for iniquities; and for bringing in an everlasting righteousness; and for sealing vision and prophet; and for anointing the Holy of Holies. Therefore thou art to know and understand, that from the going forth of a word for returning an answer and for building Jerusalem until an Anointed ruler are seven weeks, and sixty two weeks. They shall indeed return and a street shall be built and a wall, and these times shall be emptied out, and after the sixty two weeks, the Messiah shall be cut off, though there is no crime in him; and he, with the ruler who is coming, will destroy the city and the sanctuary. They shall be destroyed with a deluge, and even to the end of the war determined on in course, with desolations. Now one week shall confirm a covenant for many and in the half of that week my sacrifice and libation shall be taken away. And upon the temple shall be an abomination of the desolations, and at the end of a time, an end shall be put to that desolation.

X. IN the third year of Cyrus, king of the Persians, a word was revealed to Daniel, surnamed Baltasar. And the word is true and great power and knowledge was given him by the vision. In those days, I Daniel, had been mourning three weeks. I had not eaten palatable bread, nor had flesh or wine entered my mouth, neither had I anointed myself to the full end of three weeks. On the twenty fourth of the first month when I was on the bank of the great river, namely, Tigris Eddekel, I raised mine eyes and looked, and lo! a man clothed with a flowing robe and his loins girded with gold of Ophaz, and his body like a Tharsis, and his face like the appearance of lightning, and his eyes like lamps of fire, and his arms and his legs like the appearance of sparkling brass, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.

Now, I Daniel alone saw this vision. The men who were with me did not see it; but great consternation fell upon them and they fled for fear; so I was left alone. And when I beheld this great vision, there was no strength left in me. Even my
comeliness was changed into corruption and I retained no strength; but I heard the sound of his words. And when I heard him, I was struck with awe, and my face was on the ground. And lo! a hand touched me and raised me up upon my knees. And he said to me, Daniel, man greatly beloved, gain knowledge by the words which I speak to thee and stand up; for I am now sent to thee. And when he said this to me I stood up trembling. Then he said to me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to gain knowledge and afflict thyself before the Lord thy God, thy words were heard, and I came at thy words; but the chief of the kingdom of the Persians stood in my way twenty one days, when lo! Michael the first of the chiefs came to help me, and I left him there with the chief of the kingdom of the Persians, and am come to teach thee what will befall thy people in the last days. Because this vision is for days to come.

Now while he was speaking to me in such terms, I turned my countenance to the earth, and was in amaze; and behold a likeness as it were of a son of man touched my lips, whereupon I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to him who was standing before me, O my lord, at the sight of thee my vitals are changed, and I have no strength; how then can thy servant, O my lord, speak with this my lord? As for me, from that moment my strength could not support me and there was no spirit left in me. Then an appearance like that of a man touched me again, and strengthened me and said to me, Man much beloved, fear not: peace be to thee. Take courage and be strong. And when he had spoken to me I recovered strength and said, Let my lord speak, for thou hast strengthened me. Then he said, O that thou knewest that for which I came to thee, then would I return to fight for the chief of the Persians, for as I was coming, the chief of the Grecians came. But I will tell thee that only which is ordered in a writing of truth. There is indeed none with me solicitous about him, but only Michael your chief. As for me, I in the first year of Cyrus, was his strength and power. And now I will tell the truth: Behold yet three kings shall be raised up in Persia,
and the fourth shall abound in great wealth above all. And after he hath gotten this his great wealth he will be stirred up against all the kingdoms of the Greeks. But there will be raised up a mighty king who will be lord of a great dominion and will do according to his pleasure. But as soon as his kingdom hath been set up, it will be broken in pieces and divided towards the four winds of heaven, but not to his utmost bounds, nor according to his dominion which he ruled. For his kingdom will be torn to pieces, and given to others besides these. And the king of the south will grow strong; and one of these chiefs will grow strong against him, and will rule over a great dominion. And after his years they will come to an agreement. And a daughter of a king of the south will come to a king of the north for the purpose of making leagues with him. But he will not retain strength of arm, nor shall his seed stand; for she will be delivered up and they who bring her, both the young woman, and he who strengthens her in those times. Out of the blossom of her root one having a government of his own will be raised up, and will come to this power, and enter the strong holds of the king of the north, and perform exploits in them and prevail. And he will carry their gods with their molten images, all his precious vessels of silver and gold, with captives to Egypt; and he will stand above the king of the north who will come to the kingdom of the king of the south; and return again to his own land. But his sons will collect a multitude among many, and one will come with effect, and like a deluge, and will pass through and establish himself and the war will be carried even to his fortress. Then will the king of the south be furiously enraged, and he will come out and fight the king of the north, who will array a great multitude, but this multitude will be delivered into his hand. And when he shall take this multitude, his heart will be elated, and he will overthrow myriads, but will not prevail. For the king of the north will return, and bring a multitude greater than the former and at the end of times of years invade the frontiers with a great army, and with much wealth. And in those times many will rise up against the king of the south, and the sons of the pests of thy people will be stirred up to establish a phantom, but
15 they will be weak. For a king of the north will come and cast up a mount and take strong cities. Though the arms of the king of the south will make a stand, and his chosen men will be raised up, yet there will not be power to withstand. So that he who cometh against him, will do according to his pleasure, and there is none able to stand before him. So he will stand in the land of Sabei, and it will be perfected by his hand. Then he will set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and will settle all things equitably with him, and will give him a daughter of the women with a view to corrupt her, but she will not continue in his interest, nor be for him. Then he will turn his face to the islands, and take many, and cause chiefs to cease their reproaches: but his own reproach will be turned upon him. Then he will turn his face to the strength of his own land, and will be weak and fall, and will not be found. And from his root there will be set upon his throne a plant of royalty plundering; and taxing the glory of a kingdom. And in those days he also will be destroyed, but not with open violence nor in battle. And on his throne one will be settled, who was despised and on whom they did not confer the honour of a kingdom. But he will come to it peaceably and obtain the kingdom by obsequiousness. And the arms of the overcomer will be overwhelmed at his presence, and they with the ruler of the covenant will be destroyed. Because of the associations against him, he will practise guile and come up and overpower them with a small nation and come peaceably into rich provinces, and do what neither his fathers, nor his fathers' fathers ever did. Plunder and spoils and wealth he will scatter among them; and against Egypt he will forecast devices even for a time. And his power and his heart will be stirred up against a king of the south, with a great army; and the king of the south will join battle with an exceeding great and powerful army; but they will not stand; for they will form devices against him and devour his substance and crush him, and armies will be overwhelmed, and many wounded shall fall. Then both the kings with their hearts bent on mischief will speak lies at one table. But it will not prosper. Because an end is still put off for a time, therefore he will return to his own land with much wealth and his heart will be against
the holy covenant, and he will act and return to his own land.

29 At the time he will return and come to the south; but this last expedition will not be like the first: for the Kitians who set out at the same time will arrive, and he will be humbled. Then he will return and will be inflamed with wrath against the holy covenant. And he will act and return and keep up an intelligence with them who have forsaken the holy covenant. And seeds out of him will spring up, and the sanctuary of the dominion will be polluted; and the daily sacrifice will be removed; and there will be set up an abomination which hath caused desolation, which they who break covenant will bring in by flatteries. But the people who acknowledge their God will take courage and act. And the men of understanding among the people will keep up an intelligence for many purposes; but they will be weakened by sword and by fire, and by captivity, and by plundering, for days. And when they are weak, they will be helped with a little help. And many will join them by flatteries. Then some of the wise will be weak that they may be tried and chosen, and that at a time the end may be revealed. Because it is still for a time, therefore he will act according to his pleasure. And this king will be exalted and magnified above every god, and will speak swelling words, and prosper until the indignation is completed: for it is coming to a completion. Though with all the gods of his fathers, he will not keep up any intelligence, including even the desire of women—though he will not pay respect to any thing divine, because he will magnify himself above them all, yet in his place he will glorify god Maozim—even a god which his fathers knew not, he will glorify with gold and silver, and precious stones, and with desirable things, and act for the fortresses of them who have taken refuge with a strange God, and he will multiply glory and subject many to them and distribute lands for gifts. And at the end of a time there will be conflicts with the king of the south, and against him there will be brought a king of the north, with chariots and horsemen, and many ships, which shall invade the land, and he will break in pieces and pass through and come to the land of Sabaim, and many will be weak. But these will escape out of his hand, namely, Edom and Moab and the children
42 of Ammon. And he will stretch forth his hand against this land, and the land of Egypt will be no security. And he will be master of the hidden stores of gold and silver, and of all the desirable things of Egypt, and of the Lybians and Ethiopians, in their strong holds. And when reports and disturbances shall trouble him from the east, and from the north, he will then come with great wrath to destroy many, and he will pitch his tent at Ephadanus between the seas on the holy mountain Sabaim. Then he will come to his portion, and there is none to deliver him.

XII. And at that time Michael the great chief, who hath been over the children of thy people will stand up, and there will be a time of tribulation—a tribulation such as hath not been since there was a nation on the earth even to this time. At that time all thy people who are enrolled in the book shall be saved.
2 And many of them who sleep in mounds of earth shall be raised up, some for everlasting life and some for disgrace and everlasting shame. And they who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament, and some of the many righteous like the stars for the ages and longer.
4 As for thee, Daniel, shut up these words and seal the book till the time of accomplishment; until many be taught and knowledge abound.
5 Then I Daniel looked, and lo! two others stood, one on this bank of the river and the other on the other bank of the river. And one said to the man clothed with the flowing robes who was over the water of the river, How long to the end of these wonderful things which thou hast spoken? And I heard the man clothed with the fine robes who was over the water of the river. He lifted up his right and his left hand to heaven and sware by him who liveth forever and ever that it will be until a time of times and the half of a time. When an end is put to the dispersion, they will know all these things. As for me though I heard I did not understand. So I said, Lord,
9 What will be the issue of these things? And he said, Come Daniel. Because these words are shut up and sealed until the end of a time. Though many be chosen and made white and purified and sanctified, and transgressors transgress; yet no transgressor will understand but the prudent will understand.
11 Now from the time of the change of the daily sacrifice, when the abomination of desolation shall be set up there will be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. Happy he who will wait and come to a thousand three hundred and thirty five days. But as for thee, come and go to rest, for still there will be days and hours to the final accomplishment. And thou shalt stand up for thy portion at the end of days.

HOSEA.

1. A word of the Lord which came to Hosea the son of Beeri in the days of Ozias and Joatham and Achaz and Ezekias kings of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joas king of Israel.

The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea.

2 I. WHEN the Lord said to Hosea, "Go, take thee a wife of whoredom, and children of whoredoms, since the land is going and will go a whoring from the Lord," he then went and took Gomer a daughter of Debelaïm: and when she conceived and bore him a son, the Lord said to him, "Call his name Jezrael; for yet a little while and I will avenge the blood of Jezrael on the house of Jehu, and cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease. And it shall come to pass in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrael." And when she conceived again and bore a daughter, he said to him, "Call her name, Not-compassionated; for I will no longer continue to have compassion on the house of Israel, but will set myself against them. But on the children of Juda I will have compassion and I will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow nor by sword nor by battle nor by horses nor by horsemen."

8 And when she had weaned Not-compassionated, she conceived again and bore a son, and he said, "Call his name Not-my-people, since you are not my people and I am not your God." (Now the number of the children of Israel was like the sand of the sea which cannot be measured nor counted.)
"But it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they shall be called children of the Living God, and the children of Juda and the children of Israel shall be gathered together and shall appoint for themselves one head and come up out of the land. Because great will be the day of Jezrael; say ye to your brother, My people, and to your sister, Compassionated; empead your mother, emplead, because with regard to her, is she not my wife? And as for me, am not I her husband? Therefore I will remove her fornication from before me and her adultery from between her breasts. That I may do this I will strip her naked, and reduce her to the state she was in at her birth. I will indeed make her desolate, and order her to a land without water and kill her with thirst, and on her children I will not have compassion. Because they are children of fornication—because their mother hath committed whoredom—she, who brought them forth hath acted shamefully—because she said, 'I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, and my apparel and my fine linens, mine oil and all things convenient for me;' for this behold I will hedge up her way with thorns; and block up her ways that she may not find her path. Though she follow her lovers she shall not overtake them; though she seek them, she shall not find them. Then she will say, 'I will go and return to my former husband, for it was then better with me than now. She indeed did not acknowledge that I gave her the corn and wine and oil; and multiplied silver for her: but she made ornaments of gold and silver for Baal: therefore I will turn and take away my corn in its season, and my wine in its appointed time; and I will take away my garments and my fine linens, that she may not cover her nakedness: and I will now disclose her impurity before her lovers; and none shall deliver her out of my hand. I will indeed turn away all her pleasures, her festivals, and her new moons and her sabbaths and all her solemn assemblies. And I will lay waste her vineyards and her fig orchards—all those things respecting which she said, 'These are my rewards which my lovers gave me;' and I will make them for a memorial; and the wild beasts of the field and the birds of the air, and the
13 reptiles of the earth shall devour them. And I will punish her for the days of the baleims in which she sacrificed to them.

When she had put on her ear-rings and her jewels, she went after her lovers and forgot me, saith the Lord; therefore behold I will cause her to wander, and order her to a wilderness and speak to her heart. And thence I will give her for her possessions, even the valley of Achor to open her understanding: and she shall be humbled there as in the days of her youth, even as in the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that she will call me My husband; and no more call me Baalim. I will indeed take away the names of the Baalims out of her mouth, and their names shall no more be mentioned. And in that day I will make a covenant for them, with the wild beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the reptiles of the earth; and bow and sword and battle I will crush out of the land; and I will settle thee securely and betroth thee to myself forever. I will indeed betroth thee to myself by righteousness and by judgment and by compassion and by tender mercies: and I will betroth thee to myself by fidelity; and thou shalt acknowledge the Lord. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will hearken to the heaven, and it shall hearken to the earth, and the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil, and they shall hearken to Jezrael; and I will plant her for myself in the land, and love her who was not beloved; and to them who were not my people I will say, "Thou art my people:" and they will say, Thou the Lord art my God.

III. II. Again the Lord said to me, Still go and love a woman who loveth wickedness, even an adulteress, as God loveth the children of Israel, though they look to strange gods and love cakes with dried grapes. So I hired one for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a gomar of barley and a nebel of wine, and said to her, "Thou shalt continue many days for me and shalt not play the harlot nor have commerce with man, then I will be for thee; for the children of Israel shall continue many days without a king and without a chief, and without a sacrifice and without an altar and without a priesthood, and without manifestations; and afterwards the children of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God, and David their king:
and will be amazed at the Lord and at his goodness in the last days.

IV. III. (p) Hear a word of the Lord, O children of Israel! the Lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of this land; because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land—Cursing and lying and murder and theft and adultery are burst out on the land, and blood mingleth with blood; therefore the land shall mourn and be wasted with all its inhabitants, with the wild beasts of the fields and with the reptiles of the earth, and with the birds of the air. Even the fishes of the sea shall fail.

4 (J) In order that none may be judged, that none may reprove, this people of mine shall be like a contradicted priest, and shall be weak for years; and with thee the prophet shall be without strength. I have compared thy mother to the night: my people is like one that hath not knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, therefore I will reject thee from being my priest: as thou hast forgotten the law of thy God; I also will forget thy children. In proportion to their increase they sinned against me; I will turn their glory into shame. Shall they eat the sin offerings of my people and by their iniquities support their lives? It shall indeed be that as is the people so shall be the priest; I will punish them for their ways and retribute to him his devices. Though they eat they shall not be filled, they have committed fornications, and they cannot prosper. Because they forsook the Lord, to attend to fornication and wine, therefore the heart of my people embraced drunkenness. They consulted by symbols and gave them answers by their staves. By a spirit of fornication they were led astray; and they went a whoring from their God. They sacrificed on the tops of the mountains, and on the hills they burned incense, under an oak and a beech and a shady tree, because shade is good. For this cause your daughters will commit whoredom and your wives adultery; and I will not punish your daughters, when they commit whoredom, nor your daughters in law when they commit adultery. Because they conversed with harlots and sacrificed

(J) Jehovah. (p) The prophet speaks.
with prostitutes, therefore my people, who were without understanding, were entangled with fornication. As for thee, Israel, continue not in ignorance; and thou Juda go not to Galgala. Either go not up to the house of On, or swear not by the living Lord. Because Israel ran about madly like a heifer stung by a gad fly, the Lord will now feed them like a lamb in a roomy place. Ephraim associating with idols, laid stumbling blocks for himself. They addicted themselves to the Chananites; they went on in a continued course of whoredom; they loved dishonour because of its revelry; thou art a whirl of wind in its wings; but they shall be put to shame because of their altars.

IV. (p) Hear these things ye priests; and attend ye house of Israel, and ye household of the king give ear; for against you is this indictment, because you are become a snare in the watch tower; and like a net spread upon Itaburion, which they who hunt wild beasts have fixed up.

(J) As for me, I was your instructor. I acknowledged Ephraim, when Israel did not withdraw from me. Now because Ephraim went a whoring, Israel is polluted. They did not apply their thoughts to return to their God. Because there is a spirit of whoredom in them, and they have not acknowledged the Lord, therefore the haughtiness of Israel shall be humbled at his presence, and Israel and Ephraim shall be weakened for their iniquities. When Juda also shall be weakened with them, they will go with sheep and young bulls to seek the Lord, but they shall not find him, because he hath withdrawn from them. Because they have forsaken the Lord, because strange children have been born to them: the canker worm shall now devour them and their portions.

(p) Sound a trumpet on the mounts; raise a shout on the high places; proclaim in the house of On, Benjamin is confounded. Ephraim is become a desolation in the day of rebuke.

(J) Among the tribes of Israel I have given faithful warnings. The chiefs of Juda are become like the removers of boundaries, upon them I will pour out my fury like water. Ephraim tyrannised over his adversary, he trampled down judgment; because he set the example of going after vanities, therefore I will be like a terror to Ephraim, and like a goad to the house
13 of Juda. When Ephraim saw his disorder and Juda felt his pain, though Ephraim went to the Assyrians, and sent ambassadors to king Iarim; yet he could not heal you, nor could your pain be assuaged; for I am like a panther to Ephraim, and like a lion to the house of Juda. When I tear, I will go and take and there shall be no deliverer. I will sally forth and return to my place until they are made desolate, then they will seek my face.

VI. In their affliction they will seek me early, saying, "Come, let us return to the Lord our God, for it is he who hath torn and he can heal us. He can smite, and into our wounds he can pour balm; in two days he can restore us to health; on the third day we shall be raised up and live before him. Let us acknowledge—let us continue our pursuit to know the Lord; sure as the morning we shall find him. He will come like rain for us; like the former and latter rain for the earth."

4 What shall I do for thee, Ephraim? What shall I do for thee, Juda? As for your goodness, it was like a morning cloud—like the transient dew of the morning: for this cause I mowed down your prophets, I slew them with the word of my mouth, and my judgment shall go forth as light; for I desire mercy rather than sacrifice, and an acknowledgment of God rather than whole burnt offerings. As for them, they are like man transgressing a covenant. There the city Galaad hath contemned me; it is a framer of vanities, a troubler of water, and thy strength was that of a mighty robber. The priests concealed the way; they acted the murder at Sikima. Because they committed iniquity in the house of Israel, I saw there the horrible fornication of Ephraim. Israel is polluted. Now Juda begin an ingathering for thyself. When I bring back the captivity of my people. When I have healed Israel, then shall be disclosed the iniquity of Ephraim and the wickedness of Samaria. Because they have framed lies, therefore a thief shall come in to him, a sculking robber shall be in his way: that they may chime together like them who sing in unison. I remembered all their wickedness, now their own devices have encompassed them.

2 They were all open to my view. They made kings glad by their wickedness and chiefs by their lies. They all burn with adultery, like an oven for baking cakes, which, after putting in
the fire, after mixing the dough, is kept burning, till the dough is leavened.

5 With regard to the days of your kings, the chiefs had begun to be inflamed with wine. He had stretched forth his hand with turbulent men. Because their hearts were heated like an oven, when they had revelled the whole night, Ephraim fell fast asleep. The morning came, he was heated again like a flaming fire. They were all hot as an oven and devoured their judges; all their kings fell; there was none among them who appealed to me. Ephraim was mingled among his tribes; Ephraim was a cake under ashes, which had not been turned. Strangers devoured his strength and he did not know it; grey hairs grew upon him and he did not perceive it.

10 (p) Though it was evident that the haughtiness of Israel would be humbled, yet they did not turn to the Lord their God, nor seek him diligently for all this.

11 (J) Ephraim indeed was like a silly dove which had no understanding; he called upon Egypt: and they went to the Assyrians. Let them go where they will, I will spread my net for them, and bring them down like the birds of the air, and instruct them with the report of one another's affliction. Alas! for them, because they have departed from me. They are faint hearted, because they have transgressed against me. Though I redeemed them, yet they spoke lies against me. Their hearts do not cry to me; but only make moans on their beds—for corn and wine they were deeply affected. By me they were instructed—I indeed strengthened their arms; but they devised evils against me. They were turned back to no purpose. They were like a bended bow. Let their chiefs fall by the sword for the folly of their tongue; let the derision they endured in the land of Egypt come into their bosoms like dirt, like an eagle darting upon the house of the Lord. Because they have transgressed my covenant, and have sinned against my law, will they cry to me, "O God, we have known thee?"

3 Because Israel turned away good things they met with an enemy. They made kings for themselves but not by me—they set up a government and did not consult me; of their silver and gold they made idols for themselves that they might be utterly cut off. Away with thy calf, O Samaria! my wrath is
6 kindled against them. How long shall things which cannot be made clean be in Israel? A carpenter made it; it is no God.
7 Because thy calf, O Samaria, was an imposture—because they sowed blasted seed, therefore the catastrophe was correspondent; there is not a handful capable of yielding meal. And had it succeeded, strangers would have devoured it. Israel is swallowed up—he is now among the nations like an useless vessel,
9 because he went up to the Assyrians. While Ephraim continued at home he sprouted again. They loved gifts, therefore
10 they shall be delivered up to the nations. I will now take charge of them, and they shall cease a little while from anointing a king and chiefs. Because Ephraim multiplied altars for sins—altars were to him objects of love; I will prescribe for him a multitude. Though his rites were devised for other purposes, the altars were objects of love. For what purpose soever they offer sacrifices and eat flesh, the Lord will not accept them; he will now remember their iniquities and punish their sins. They turned back to Egypt, therefore among the Assyrians they shall eat unclean things. Israel indeed forgot his Maker and built fanes, and Juda multiplied fenced cities; but into these cities of his I will send a fire, and it shall devour those buildings of theirs.

IX. Rejoice not, Israel; nor be elated like the tribes, because thou hast gone a whoring from thy God. Thou didst love
2 gifts on every corn floor; floor and press have disowned them,
3 and the wine hath disappointed them. They did not dwell in the land of the Lord: Ephraim became an inhabitant of Egypt; therefore among the Assyrians they shall eat unclean things.
4 They did not pour out wine to the Lord nor offer him sweet incense; their sacrifices shall be to them like the bread of affliction; all that eat thereof shall be polluted. Seeing their funeral loaves cannot come into the house of the Lord, what will you do on the day of a solemn assembly; and on a day of a festival of the Lord? For this cause behold they are going from the misery of Egypt, and Memphis shall receive them and Machmas shall bury them. As for their silver, destruction shall inherit it. Thorns shall be in their habitations. The days of the visitation are come; at hand are the days of thy recompence: and Israel shall be afflicted like the prophet who
was struck with horror—the man who had been inspired. By the multitude of thine iniquities thy madness was increased.

8 (p) Ephraim was a watchman with God, a prophet was a cunning snare in all his ways, they had fixed a madness by a house of God; they were corrupt as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity; he will punish their sins.

9 (J) I found Israel as a bunch of grapes in a wilderness; and I saw their fathers like an early watcher in a fig orchard. They went to Belphagor and abandoned themselves to shame, and became abominable, compared with the beloved. Ephraim is flown like a bird; their glories from parentage, births and conceptions are gone. For though they bring up their children, they shall be bereaved of them from among men: for (and alas for them! my flesh is of them) Ephraim, as I have seen, have roused their children for a hunt—even Ephraim hath, that he may lead out his children to a fatal conflict. Give them—

14 (p) (O Lord what wilt thou give them?)
(J) —A womb incapable of bearing children and dry breasts.

15 All their wickedness was occasioned by Galgal; because I hated them there on account of the wickedness of their devices, I will drive them out of my house; I will no longer continue to love them. All their chiefs are become rebellious. Ephraim is in distress. His roots are withered. He shall no more produce fruit. For though they bring forth, I will slay the beloved fruit of the womb. God will cast them off because they hearkened not to him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.

X. Israel was a vine with beautiful branches: the fruit thereof was abundant. In proportion to the abundance of his fruit he multiplied altars: in proportion to the good things of his land he erected pillars. They divided their hearts; they shall now be destroyed. He will demolish their altars. Their pillars shall be in extreme distress. Because they will now say, "We have no king, because we feared not the Lord." But as for this king, what can he do for us? Speaking words, false pretences, will he make a covenant? Will judgment spring up like a weed in an uncultivated field? Let the inhabitants of Samaria sojourn with the calf of the house of On, because its people mourned for it. Now as they provoked it they should rejoice
6 at its glory—that it hath been removed from them. They indeed having bound it, carried it to the Assyrians, as a present to the king Iarim. As an homage gift of Ephraim he will receive it, and Israel shall be exposed to shame by his counsel.
7 Samaria hath cast away her king as a chip on the surface of water. The altars of On, the stumbling blocks of Israel shall indeed be taken away; thorns and thistles shall grow on their altars, and they will say to the hills, cover us, and to the mounts, Fall upon us. From the time of those mounts, Israel sinned: it was there they stood. Should not battle against these children of iniquity overtake them on this mount, to chastise them? Peoples shall indeed be gathered against them, when they are corrected for their two iniquities. Ephraim is a heifer taught to love victory; but I will come against her beautiful neck; I will bring Ephraim into subjection; I will cause Juda to keep silence; Jacob shall wrestle for himself.
12 (p) Sow for yourselves for righteousness; gather in the fruit of life. Light up for yourselves the light of knowledge. Seek the Lord until the fruits of righteousness come for you.
13 Why have you concealed impiety and gathered in the iniquities thereof? You have eaten false fruit.
(J) Because thou hast trusted in thy sins, and in the multitude of thine army, therefore destruction shall be raised up among thy people; and all thy fortifications shall be swept away, as chief Salamin was out of the house of Jeroboam. In the days of battle a mother was dashed to pieces upon her children. In this manner I will deal with you, O house of Israel, because of the perverseness of your iniquities.
(p) Early in the morning they have been rejected! the king of Israel is cast off!
XI. (J) When Israel was young I loved him, and I called his children out of Egypt. The more I called them, the more they ran from my presence. They sacrificed to the Baalims, and burned incense to graven images; therefore I bound Ephraim's feet. I took him up in my arms. When they did not know that I heal by the destruction of men, I bound them with the cords of my love. Now I will be to them as a man who slappeth his cheeks, and I will keep an eye upon him, and exercise authority over him. Ephraim dwelt in Egypt,
though Assur was his king. Because he refused to return, he was weakened in his cities by the sword. And it caused him to rest with his hands; and they shall eat the fruit of their devices.

7 (p) His people are indeed in imminent danger of being removed from their dwelling, will God be provoked against his honours so as never to exalt him?

8 (J) What shall I do with thee, Ephraim? Shall I shield thee, Israel? What must I do with thee? Shall I make thee as Adama and as Seboim? My heart relenteth for him. My compassion is moved. I will not act according to the fierceness of mine indignation, I will not give up Ephraim to utter destruction. For I am God and am not man—The Holy One in the midst of thee.

10 (p) Am I then not to enter a city? Am I to follow the Lord? Will he roar like a lion? And because of his roaring, will the children of waters be affrighted?

11 (J) They shall be frighted like a bird out of Egypt, and like a dove out of the land of the Assyrians. And I will bring them back to their own homes, saith the Lord.

12 Ephraim encompassed me with a lie, and the house of Israel and Juda, with impieties. Now God had acknowledged them, and they were to be called the holy people of God.—XII. But this Ephraim is an evil spirit, he pursued a blasting wind the whole day. He multiplied emptiness and vanity. Though he made a covenant with the Assyrians, yet oil went continually to Egypt. With Juda also the Lord hath controversy. To vindicate Jacob, he will retribute to him, according to his ways, and according to his devices. In the womb Jacob kicked his brother, but in his troubles he wrestled with God. He indeed wrestled with an angel and prevailed. Have they wept or have they supplicated me? Have they found me in the house of On? Or have they been spoken to there?

5 The Lord God Almighty was to be his memorial: To thy God therefore thou art to return. Keep mercy and judgment and draw near to thy God continually.

7 As for Chanaan, in his hand is a deceitful balance. He loved to tyrannise. Ephraim indeed said, "But I am rich, I have found a rest for myself." Because of the iniquities which he
hath committed, none of his labours shall turn to account. I 9 the Lord am thy God. I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, I will yet cause thee to dwell in tents, as in the days 10 of a festival. Shall I speak to prophets? Though I have multiplied visions, and by the ministry of prophets made comparisons, was it only because of Galaad? There were liars indeed at Galaad—chiefs sacrificing; but their altars were like heaps in an uncultivated field.

12 (p) Though Jacob fled to the plain of Syria, and Israel made himself a slave for a wife, and for a wife kept watch, yet by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of the land of Egypt and by a prophet he was preserved.

13 (J) Ephraim hath kindled indignation and provoked to wrath; his blood therefore shall be poured out on him, and XIII. the Lord will retribute to him his reproach. According to Ephraim's own account he received rules of rectitude by Israel, but he attributed them to Baal and incurred death.

2 And now they have proceeded on to greater acts of sin; and of their silver have made themselves a molten image, according to the image of idols. The handiworks of craftsmen being consecrated for them, They say, Sacrifice men, for young bulls have failed. For this cause they shall be like a morning cloud, and like a transient dew of the morning—like chaff blown from a winnowing floor and like a vapour from tears.

4 As for me, I the Lord thy God am he who established the heaven, and created the earth, whose hands have created all the host of heaven; but I did not display these to thee that thou shouldst go after them: as I have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt; therefore thou shalt acknowledge no God besides me. Indeed besides me there is no Saviour. It was I who fed thee in the desert—in an uninhabited land. When in their pastures they were fed to the full; then were their hearts lifted up. For this cause they for- got me. Therefore I will be to them as a tiger, even as a tigress in the way to the Assyrians. I will meet them as a bear bereaved of her cubs, and rend the covering of their heart; and the young lions of the forest shall there devour them; and the beasts of the field shall tear them to pieces. In thy destruction,

10 O Israel, who can give succour? Where is this king of thine?
Let him save thee in all thy cities. Let him judge thee, of whom thou saidst, "Give me a king and a chief." I gave thee a king in mine indignation, and in my wrath restrained the whirlwind of Ephraim's iniquity. As his sin is carefully laid up in store, pangs as of a woman in travail shall come upon him.

(p) With regard to that son of thine who is prudent, why may not he survive in the destruction of children.

(J) Him I will deliver from the power of the grave, and from death I will redeem them.

(p) O death, where is thy punishment? Where thy sting, O grave? Is comfort hid from mine eyes? Since he will make a distinction among brethren; let the Lord bring upon him a blasting wind from the desert, and let it dry up his veins and lay waste his fountains; let it parch up his land and all his precious stores.

(J) Samaria shall be utterly destroyed: because she rebelled against her God, they shall fall by the sword; and their infants shall be dashed to pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.

XIV. (p) O Israel, return to the Lord thy God. Seeing they have been weakened for thine iniquities, take words with you and return to the Lord your God, and, that you may not receive the punishment of iniquity but may receive good things, say to him, "We will render to thee the fruit of our lips. Assur cannot save us. We will no more mount horses; we will no more say to the works of our hand, 'You are our gods.'" He who is in thee will compassionate the fatherless.

(J) I will heal their habitations. I will undoubtedly love them. Because he hath turned away my wrath from him, I will be to Israel like dew. He shall bloom like a lily, and shoot out his roots like Lebanon. His branches shall spread; and he shall be like a fruitful olive tree, and like that of Lebanon shall be his fragrance. They shall return and dwell under his shade; they shall live and be plentifully fed with corn. And he shall flourish like a vine and the memorial of him shall be like the wine of Lebanon. As for Ephraim, what hath he any more to do with idols? I humbled him and I will strengthen
him. I am like a fruitful juniper; from me thou shalt find fruit.

9 (p) Who is wise that he may understand these things, prudent, that he may know them? Because the ways of the Lord are straight; therefore the righteous will walk in them: But in them the wicked shall be without strength.

JOEL.

I. A word of the Lord which came to Joel son of Bathuel.

2 HEAR these things ye elders! And give ear all ye inhabitants of the land! Have such things happened in your days,
3 or in the days of your fathers? Of these things give an account to your children; and let your children tell their children; and their children, another generation.
4 The leavings of the palmer worm have been devoured by the grasshopper, and the leavings of the grasshopper have been devoured by the locust. And the mildew hath consumed what the locust left.
5 Awake ye drunkards, from your wine and weep. Sing a mournful song all ye who drink wine to drunkenness; for joy and gladness are gone from your mouth. For against my land a nation is come up, strong and innumerable. Their teeth are the teeth of lions; and their grinders, those of a young lion.
7 They have made my vineyard a desolation; and my fig orchards, a waste. They have searched it thoroughly and it is gone to wreck; they have made the branches thereof white.
8 Let thy song of woe before me be more plaintive than that of a bride clothed with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
9 Sacrifice and libation are taken away from the house of the Lord. Mourn ye priests, who minister at the Lord's altar, because
10 the fields are wasted. Let the land mourn: because the corn hath suffered grievously: wine is dried away; oil is diminished; husbandmen are parched up. Mourn, ye farms, for the wheat and barley, because the harvester is perished from the field. The vines are withered and the fig trees are diminished; peach and palm and citron trees and all the trees of the field are withered. Because the children of men are ashamed:
of joy, gird yourselves, ye priests, and lament bitterly: sing the song of woe, ye who minister at the altar; go in and sleep in sackcloth, ye ministers of God. Because sacrifice and libation are withheld from the house of your God. Set apart a fast; proclaim a solemn service; assemble the elders—all the inhabitants of the land, to the house of your God, and cry to the Lord incessantly, "Ah me! Ah me! Ah me! for the day."

For the day of the Lord is at hand; and it will come like destruction on destruction. Food is utterly destroyed before your eyes—joy and gladness, from the house of your God. The heifers startled at their stalls. Stores are exhausted; wine lakes are gone to ruin. As the corn is blasted, what shall we substitute for ourselves? The herds of cattle uttered mournful lowings, because there was no pasture for them; and the flocks of sheep are utterly destroyed. To thee, O Lord, let me cry for myself, because a fire hath consumed the pleasant places of the wilderness, and a flame hath blasted all the trees of the field. To thee indeed the cattle in the plain have looked up, because the springs of water are quite dry, and a fire hath devoured the pleasant places of the wilderness.

II. Blow the trumpet in Sion; make proclamation on my holy mountain. And let all the inhabitants of the land be alarmed.

For the day of the Lord is approaching—for it is near—a day of darkness and gloom—a day of clouds and thick darkness. Like dawn, there shall be poured out on the mountains a people numerous and powerful, the like of them hath never been, nor shall be any more to the years of all generations. Before them is a kindling fire, and all behind them a glowing flame. Before them the land is like a pleasure garden, and behind them, a scene of desolation: and there is none who can escape them. Their appearance is like the appearance of horses; and like horsemen they can pursue. With a noise like that of chariots they will bound over the tops of mountains and their noise is like that of a flaming fire consuming stubble. They are like a people numerous and powerful, arrayed for battle.

At their presence peoples will be appalled and every face covered with blackness. They can run like warriors and like mighty warriors scale walls; and every one will march in his own path. They will not alter their lines of march; nor will any-
one separate from his comrade. They will march loaded with their arms, and though they fall on their weapons they shall not be killed. They will surprise the city and run upon the walls; they will climb up the houses and enter at windows like thieves. At their presence the earth will be confounded and the heaven shaken, and the sun and the moon will be darkened, and the stars will withdraw their refulgence, and the Lord will utter his voice before his army. Because the circuit of his camp is very large—because the operation of his words is irresistible—because the day of the Lord is great, extremely awful; who therefore shall be able to abide it? Now therefore saith the Lord your God, turn to me with your whole heart, and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning. Rend your hearts and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God; for he is gracious and merciful, long suffering and full of compassion, and relenteth at evils. Who knoweth but he will turn and relent, and leave behind him a blessing and a sacrifice and a libation for the Lord your God.

Sound the trumpet in Sion. Appoint a fast; proclaim a solemn act of worship. Assemble the people; sanctify the congregation; choose elders. Bring together infants at the breast. Let the bridegroom come forth from his chamber and the bride from her wardrobe. At the foot of the altar, let the priests who minister to the Lord, weep, and say, Spare, O Lord, thy people; and give not up thy heritage to reproach—for the nations to rule over them.

That they may not say among the nations, "Where is their God?" the Lord was indeed jealous for his land and spared his people. And the Lord answered and said to his people, Behold I will send you corn and wine and oil, and with them you shall be plentifully supplied. And I will no more make you a reproach among the nations. This army from the north I will remove from you, and drive it to a land without water, and destroy its front in the first and its rear in the last sea: and its smell shall come up and its stench shall ascend, because it hath magnified its works.

(p) Take courage, O land, rejoice and be glad; for it is the Lord who made it great to perform exploits. Take courage, O beasts of the field; for the plains of the wilderness are
in bloom. Because the trees have yielded their fruit—the fig tree and the vine have put forth their strength; rejoice therefore, ye children of Sion and exult in the Lord your God: for he hath given you this food for righteousness, and he will dis- til upon you the former and the latter rain as heretofore. And your threshing floors shall be filled with corn, and your vats shall overflow with wine and oil.

(J) I will indeed make you compensation for what hath been devoured by the grasshopper and the locust, the palmer worm and the mildew—that great army of mine which I sent against you. And you shall eat plentifully and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of the Lord your God, who hath dealt wonderfully with you; and my people shall never be put to shame. And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I the Lord am your God and besides me there is no other; and my people shall never be put to shame. And it shall come to pass after these things that I will pour out a portion of my spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy; and your old men shall dream dreams; and your young men shall see visions. And on my servants and on my hand maids in those days I will pour out a portion of my spirit. And I will exhibit wonders in heaven and on the earth, blood and fire and smoky vapour. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and illustrious day of the Lord. But whoever will call on the name of the Lord shall be saved; for on mount Si- on and in Jerusalem shall be the Saviour, as the Lord hath said, and the publishers of glad tidings, whom the Lord hath called.

III. Because, lo! Here I am in those days and at that time when I have brought back the captivity of Juda and Jerusalem; and I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the valley of Josaphat and plead with them there for my people and my heritage, Israel, who have been scattered among the nations.

They indeed divided my land among themselves and cast lots for my people; they gave my boys to harlots and sold my girls for wine and drank it. Now what have you, Tyre and Si- don and all Galilee of foreign tribes, to do with me? Are you rendering me a retribution? Or are you venting your spite
against me? On your heads I will severely and speedily return your retribution. Because you have taken my silver and my gold, and carried my choicest goods into your temples, and sold the sons of Juda and the sons of Jerusalem to the Greeks, that you might remove them far from their borders; therefore behold I will raise them up from the places whither you sold them, and return your retribution on your heads. And I will deliver your sons and your daughters into the hands of the sons of Juda, that they may sell them as captives to a far distant nation.

Because the Lord hath spoken, proclaim these things among the nations. Declare war: rouse the warriors: assemble and march up, all ye men of war. Beat your ploughshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weak say, I am strong. Assemble and come all ye nations around and be there gathered together. Let the man of peace become a soldier. Let all the nations be roused and come up to the valley of Josaphat; for there I will sit to judge all the nations around. Put to the sickles, for the harvest is come; go in and tread for the vat is full. Cause the wine lakes to overflow: for their wicked deeds have been multiplied. Screams resound in the valley of Judgment! Because the day of the Lord in the valley of Judgment is at hand. The sun and the moon shall be obscured in darkness; and the stars shall withdraw their fulgurance; and the Lord will utter a shout from Sion, and from Jerusalem he will send forth his voice; and the heaven and the earth shall be shaken: but the Lord will spare his people and strengthen the sons of Israel. And ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, who dwell in Sion my holy mountain, and Jerusalem shall be holy and strangers shall no more pass through it. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall distil new wine; and the hills shall send forth streams of milk; and all the fountains of Juda shall pour out water; and a fountain shall issue from the house of the Lord, which shall water the valley of bulrushes. Egypt shall be a desolation, and Idumea a scene of destruction, for the injuries done to the children of Juda—for their having shed innocent blood in their land: but Judea shall be inhabited for ever, and Jerusalem for generations of generations: and I will
make inquisition for their blood, and will not pass it over unrevenged: and the Lord will dwell in Sion.

AMOS.

1. The words of Amos which came to him at Akkarim of Thekoue, which came to him in vision concerning Jerusalem in the days of Ozias king of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joas, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. And he said,

2 From Sion the Lord hath spoken with majesty, and from Jerusalem he uttered his voice, and the pastures of the shepherds mourned, and the top of Carmel withered. And the Lord said,
    For the three transgressions of Damascus, and for four shall I not be averse from it?
    Because with iron saws they sawed asunder the pregnant wives of the men of Galaad; therefore I will send a fire into the house of Azael, and it shall devour the foundations of Ben-Ader. And I will break the bars of Damascus, and utterly destroy the inhabitants out of the plain of On, and I will cut off a tribe from the men of Charran, and the chosen people of Syria shall be made captives, saith the Lord.

6 Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, shall I not be averse from them? Because they captivated the captives of the Salamonites, to deliver them up to Idumea; therefore I will send a fire against the walls of Gaza, and it shall devour the foundations thereof. And I will utterly destroy inhabitants out of Azotus, and a tribe shall be taken away from Ascalon; and I will lay my hand on Akkaron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall be destroyed saith the Lord.

9 Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of Tyre, and for four shall I not be averse from it? Because they delivered up the captives of the Salamonites to Idumea, and did not remember the covenant of brothers; therefore I will send a fire against the walls of Tyre, and it shall devour the foundation thereof.
11 Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of Idumea, and for four shall I not be averse from it? Because they pursued their brother with a sword, and violated a mother on the ground: he indeed to evidence his intention seized by force; he kept up his horror and his onset till he accomplished his purpose; therefore I will send a fire against Thaiman, and it shall consume the foundation of its walls.

12 Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of the Ammonites, and for four shall I not be averse from them? Because they ripped up the pregnant wives of the Galaadites,

13 that they might enlarge their own borders; therefore against the walls of Rabbath I will kindle a fire, which shall consume its foundations, with a shout in the day of battle; and it shall

15 be shaken in the day of its destruction; and its kings shall go into captivity, and their priests, and their chiefs together, saith the Lord.

II. Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of Moab, and for four shall I not be averse from him? Because he burned into lime the bones of the king of Idumea; therefore I will send a fire into Moab, and it shall devour the foundations of her cities, and Moab shall die of weakness:

3 with shouting and with the clangour of trumpets, I will cut off her judge, and slay all her chiefs with him, saith the Lord.

4 Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of the children of Juda, and for four, shall I not be averse from him? Because they have rejected the law of the Lord, and have not kept his commandments, and have been led astray by their vanities which they made, which their fathers had followed; therefore I will send a fire against Juda, and it shall devour the foundations of Jerusalem.

6 Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of Israel, and for four, shall I not be averse from him? Because they sold a righteous one for silver and a needy one for a pair of sandals; and dashed their sandals against the heads of the poor; and turned aside the way of the meek; and a son and a father

8 went in unto the same handmaid. That they might profane the name of their God, having bound their garments with cords of rushes, they pitched their tents near the altar, and drank, in

9 the house of their God, wine got by extortion. As for me, I
removed from before them the Amorite whose stature was like that of a cedar. Though he was strong as an oak, I withered his fruit above and his roots underneath. I indeed brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you about in the wilderness forty years, that you might inherit the land of the Amorites. And I took some of your sons for prophets, and some of your young men for a state of sanctification. Are not these things so, O children of Israel? Saith the Lord. But you caused my sanctified ones to drink wine; and charged the prophets, saying, "You shall not prophesy:" Therefore behold I will roll under you, as a cart rolleth which is loaded with sheaves, so that flight shall perish from the swift runner; and the strong will not be master of his strength; and the warrior shall not save his life. And the bowman shall not stand, nor shall the swift of foot escape; even the horseman shall not save his life. The mighty will not know how to act with their forces: the naked shall, in that day, pursue, saith the Lord.

III. (p) Hear this word which the Lord hath spoken against you, O house of Israel!

(J) Yes, against every tribe which I brought out of the land of Egypt, saying, Of all the tribes of the earth, I acknowledge none but you. Therefore I will punish you for all your sins.

(p) Will two walk together continually unless they agree? Will a lion roar from his forest when he hath no prey? Will a young lion utter a continued roar from his den unless he be tearing something? Will a bird fall on the ground unless he be shot? Will a gin on the ground be loosened, unless something be caught? Shall a trumpet sound in a city and the people not be alarmed? Can there be in a city a calamity which the Lord hath not inflicted? Seeing the Lord will not do any thing without giving warning to his servants; shall a lion roar and none be struck with dread? Hath the Lord spoken and will none prophesy? Make proclamation in the provinces of Assyria, and in the regions of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria, and see many wonderful things in the midst thereof, and the cruel oppression which is in it. Now did she not know things which will be before her? Saith the
Lord. They are treasuring up injustice and misery in their countries. Therefore, thus saith the Lord God, "Tyre is all around. Thy land shall be wasted." He will break thy power and thy regions shall be ravaged. Thus saith the Lord, "As when a shepherd snatcheth from the mouth of a lion two legs or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be snatched, who dwell in Samaria over against that tribe and in Damascus."

Hear ye priests, and testify to the house of Israel, saith the Lord Almighty, That on the day when I punish Israel for his impieties, I will execute vengeance also on the altars of Bethel; and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground. I will confound and smite the turretted house over the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish; and many other houses shall perish with them, saith the Lord.

Hear this word, ye heifers of Basanitis, ye who are on the mountain of Samaria; who tyrannise over the distressed and trample the needy, who say to your masters, Bring and let us drink. The Lord sweareth by his Holies, that lo! days are coming upon you when fiery pestilent men will seize you with arms; and throw them with you into boiling kettles: and you shall be dragged out naked over against one another, and cast out naked on the mountain Romman, saith the Lord. You have gone to Baithel and committed transgression, to Galgala and multiplied transgressions, and have offered your sacrifices every morning, and your tythes every three days; for having publicly read a law they proclaimed thanksgivings. Proclaim them, because in such things the children of Israel delight, saith the Lord. But as for me, I will give you gnashing of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places.

When you returned not to me, saith the Lord, I withheld from you the rain three months before harvest; with an intent to rain on one city and on another city not to rain. One part was to be watered, and the part on which I did not rain, to be dried up; so that two or three cities should crowd to one city for drink and not be satisfied.

And when you turned not to me, saith the Lord, I smote you with blasting and mildew: you multiplied your gardens:
the caterpillar devoured your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive orchards.

10 When even for this you turned not to me, saith the Lord, I sent death among you by the way of Egypt, and slew your young men with the sword and gave up your horses to capture:
11 and by your rage I involved your camps in fire. And when even for this you turned not to me, saith the Lord, I overthrew you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah; and you became like a brand plucked out of fire.

12 Now as even for this you have not turned to me, saith the Lord, therefore in this manner will I deal with thee, Israel. But because I will deal thus with thee, prepare, O Israel, to invoke thy God: for behold here am I, who give strength to thunder—Who create wind, and proclaim for men his anointed one—who make the morning dawn and thick darkness, and who walk on the high places of the earth, whose name is the Lord God, Omnipotent.

V. (p) Hear this word of the Lord—a song of woe which I take up respecting you. The house of Israel is fallen. Shall it never more rise again? The virgin of Israel is prostrate on the ground. Is there none to raise her up? For this cause thus saith the Lord, Lord, of the city from which a thousand marched, there shall be left a hundred; and of the city, from which a hundred marched, ten shall be left to the house of Israel.

4 Therefore, thus saith the Lord to the house of Israel, Seek me and you shall live. But seek not Baithel, nor go to Galgal,
5 nor pass on to the Well of Oath: because Galgal shall surely go into captivity, and Baithel shall be as if it had never existed. Seek the Lord and live, that the house of Joseph may not blaze like a fire, and devour him: and the house of Israel have none

7 to quench it. He is the exalter of judgment and hath established righteousness for the earth. He is the maker and the former of all things. He turneth darkness into day, and darkeneth the day into night. He calleth to him the water of the sea, and

9 poureth it out on the face of the earth. His name is the Lord. He setteth destruction against strength and bringeth misery on bulwarks.

10 (J) They hated a reprobate in the gates and held in abhorrence a holy word; therefore because they have beaten the
poor with their fists, though you had received from them choice gifts; you have built houses of hewn stone; but in them you shall not dwell; you have planted lovely vineyards, but you shall not drink the wine thereof.

12 (p) Because I know your manifold impieties and your sins are mighty—you trample down the righteous, take pledges and turn aside the poor in the gates; therefore the prudent will at that time be silent because it is the time of wicked men.
14 Seek good and not evil that you may live, and so the Lord God Almighty will be with you. As you have said, We have hated evil and loved good; therefore re-establish judgment in the gates, that the Lord God Almighty may have compassion on the remnant of Joseph. For this purpose, saith the Lord, the God Almighty, in all the streets let there be wailing, and in all the highways let them say, Alas! Alas! Let the husbandman be called to lamentation and mourning, and to them who are skilled in the song of woe. And in all the ways let there be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, said the Lord. Alas for them who desire the day of the Lord! Why should you desire the day of the Lord, when it is darkness and not light? As if a man would flee from the face of a lion and a bear met him, or, as if one would leap into a house and leaning his hand on the wall a serpent bit him. Is not this day of the Lord darkness and not light—even thick darkness, in which there is not a ray of light?

21 (J) I have hated, I have rejected your festivals, and I will not smell your sacrifices at your solemn assemblies. Therefore though you offer me whole burnt offerings, I will not accept your sacrifices nor regard your sumptuous peace offerings.
23 Take from me the noise of thy songs, and let me not hear the melody of musical instruments; but let judgment roll down like water, and righteousness like an impassable torrent. Did you, O house of Israel, offer to me burnt offerings and sacrifices, forty years in the wilderness? You have indeed taken up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Raiphon—those types of them which you have made for yourselves. Therefore I will remove you beyond Damascus; saith the Lord, the God whose name is the Almighty.

VI. Alas for them who despise Sion and have put their trust
in the mount of Samaria. They have gathered as a vintage 2 the governments of nations and gone in. O house of Israel, Go ye all over [to Chalane] and see, and thence pass on to Ematrab and thence go down to Gath of the Philistines, to the strongest of all those kingdoms of theirs. Are their borders larger than yours, who are coming to an evil day, who are drawing near and on the point of touching false sabbaths? 4 Some of you are sleeping on beds of ivory and lolling at ease on their couches, and eating kids from the flocks, and from 5 the herds calves fed with milk: some are dwelling on the sound of musical instruments; as if they thought it fixed and not fleeting. Some are drinking filtered wine and anointing themselves with most precious ointment and have no feeling: 7 for the affliction of Joseph. Now for this cause, from being a government of mighties they shall be captives, and the neighing of horses shall be taken away from Ephraim. For the Lord hath sworn by himself, As I abhor all this haughtiness of Jacob and have hated all his regions, therefore I will 9 destroy cities with all their inhabitants. And it shall come to pass that if ten head men be left in one family, they shall die and the residue shall be left and their domestics shall succeed them. And when they are pressed to bring their bones out of the house, one will say to them who are over the family, Are there any more yet with thee? And when one will say, There 11 is no more: then will one say, Forbear to mention the name of the Lord on this account; for behold the Lord commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches and the small house with fractures. Can horses pursue among rocks? Will they refrain from whinnying at females? Because you have turned judgment into fury, and the fruit of righteousness 13 into bitterness, some rejoicing in a thing of naught, and others saying, "Have we not by our own strength taken horns?" Therefore, behold I will raise up against you, O house of Israel, a nation, saith the Lord of hosts, who shall afflict you that you may not enter the bay of Aimath, nor approach the brook at the settings of the sun.

VII. (p) So the Lord God pointed out to me, and lo! an eastern swarm of locusts was coming and behold a brouchus locust, one Gog, was their king; and when they had complete-
ly devoured the grass of the land, I said, O Lord, Lord, be appeased. Who shall raise up Jacob? Because he is very small, relent, O Lord at this.

This therefore shall not be, saith the Lord.

So the Lord pointed out to me, and lo! the Lord had called for the punishment by fire and it was devouring the great abyss and consuming the portion of the Lord, whereupon I said, Cease, O Lord, I beseech thee. Who shall raise up Jacob? Because he is very small, relent, O Lord, at this. This then shall not be, saith the Lord.

So the Lord pointed out to me; and lo! he was standing on a wall of adamant and in his hand was an adamant. And the Lord said to me, What dost thou see, Amos? And when I said, An Adamant; the Lord said to me, Behold I interpose an adamant in the midst of my people Israel that I may no more permit them to transgress. Ridiculous altars shall indeed be utterly destroyed and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with a sword.

Then Amasias the priest of Baithel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos is raising insurrections against thee in the midst of the house of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words. For thus Amos saith, "Jeroboam shall die by the sword; and Israel shall be carried away captive from his land."

Moreover Amasias said to Amos, Begone, seer. Get thee to the land of Juda and dwell there; and prophesy there: but against Baithel thou shalt not continue to prophesy; for it is the sanctuary of the king. It is the king's house. Whereupon Amos answered and said to Amasias, I was not a prophet, nor a son of a prophet. I was only a herdsman and a gatherer of dates; and the Lord took me from the flocks and the Lord said to me, Go and prophesy against my people Israel. Now therefore hear a word of the Lord, Thou sayst, "Prophesy not against Israel," and "Thou shalt not give any disturbance to Israel." Therefore thus saith the Lord,

"Thy wise shall be a prostitute in the city; and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword; and thy land shall be measured out with a line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land; and Israel shall be carried captive from his land."
VIII. So the Lord, Lord pointed out to me, and lo! a fowler's basket. And he said, Amos, what dost thou see? And when I said, A fowler's basket, the Lord said to me, The end is come upon my people Israel. I will no more permit them to transgress. In that day indeed the vaulted cielings of this temple shall resound with cries of woe, saith the Lord, Lord. Multitudes are fallen every where, I will bring on silence.

(p) Hear this, I beseech you, ye who every morning oppress the needy, and by your tyranny drive the poor from the land, saying, When will the new moon be over that we may buy? And the sabbaths, that we may open store? to make the measure small, and the weight heavy, and to make the balance uneven, that we may purchase the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals, when from every kind of product we shall have made gain. The Lord sweareth, in opposition to this arrogance of Jacob, that none of these works of yours shall ever be forgotten. Now for these things shall not the land be troubled and every inhabitant therein mourn? Destruction indeed shall swell like a river, and flow down like the river of Egypt. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, Lord, That the sun shall set at noon day, and the light on that day shall be darkened on the earth. And I will turn your festivals into mourning, and all your songs into songs of lamentation. And I will bring sackcloth on every loin and baldness on every head, and cause a mourning for him like that for a beloved, and for them with him, like that of a day of sorrow.

Behold days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will send a famine against the land—not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water; but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord. And they shall fluctuate as water from sea to sea, and run to and fro; from north to east seeking the word of the Lord, and shall not find it. In that day the fair virgins and young men shall faint for thirst. They who swear by the atonement of Samaria, and they who say, Thy God, O Dan, liveth: thy God, O Bersabee, liveth, shall indeed fall and shall never rise any more.

IX. I saw the Lord standing on the altar, and he said, Smite the propitiatory and let the porches be shaken, and cut them down on the heads of them all; and those of them who are left
I will slay with the sword. Such of them as flee shall not get away; and such of them as escape shall not be saved. Though they hide themselves in the mansion of the dead, thence my hand will drag them up. And though they climb up to heaven, thence I will bring them down. Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, I will there search them out and take them. And should they go down from my sight into the depths of the sea, I will there give orders to the dragon and he will bite them. And if they go into captivity before their enemies, I will there command the sword and it shall slay them. I will indeed keep mine eyes fixed on them for evils and not for good—even I who am the Lord, the Lord God Almighty who toucheth the earth and shaketh it, and all its inhabitants shall mourn, and its destruction shall swell like a river, and flow down like the river of Egypt; who buildeth his stairs up to heaven, and his tribunal on the foundations of the earth; who calleth to him the water of the sea and poureth it out on the face of the earth, the Lord Almighty is his name.

Are not you, O Israelites, the same to me as the Ethiopians, saith the Lord. Did I not bring Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines out of Cappadocia and the Syrians from Both-ras? Behold the eyes of the Lord God are against every kingdom of sinners, and I will cut it off from the face of the earth. But because I will not utterly destroy the house of Israel, saith the Lord, therefore I order, and I will scatter the house of Israel among all the nations, as if they were winnowed with a fan; and not a morsel of it shall fall on this land. By the sword all the sinners of my people shall die, who say, These evils shall not come near nor fall upon us.

In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David which hath fallen; I will rebuild those parts of it which have fallen to decay, and repair what have been demolished. I will indeed rebuild it as in the days of old, that the rest of mankind may seek [the Lord] even all the nations who are called by my name, saith the Lord who doth all these things.

Behold the days are coming, saith the Lord, When the harvester shall overtake the grape gatherer; and the grape shall begin to ripen at seeding time; and the mountains shall distil sweet wine; and all the hills shall be planted. And I will bring
back the captivity of my people Israel; and they shall rebuild the wasted cities and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof; and make gardens and eat the fruits of them. I will indeed plant them in their own land; and they shall no more be rooted up from the land, which I have given them, saith the Lord God Almighty.

OBADIAH.

The vision of Obadiah.

Thus saith the Lord God to Idumea, (I heard the report from the Lord. When he sent a message to the nations. Arise and let us go up against it to battle.) Behold I have made thee very small among the nations: thou art dishonoured in a high degree. The pride of thy heart puffed thee up, dwelling in the clefts of rocks. (Having made his habitation high he said in his heart, Who can bring me down to the ground?) Though thou shouldst soar aloft like an eagle, and make thy nest among the stars; thence I will pull thee down, saith the Lord. If thieves come to thee, or robbers by night; in what place soever thou mayst be cast; would they not steal what would satisfy them? And if grape gatherers came to thee, would they leave no gleaning? How Esau hath been searched! are even his hidden stores left? They have driven thee to the borders. All the men in league with thee, have risen up against thee. Thy men of peace prevailed against thee. They laid snares under thee. They have no understanding.

In that day, saith the Lord, I will destroy wise men out of Idumea, and understanding out of the mount of Esau. And thy warriors from Thaiman shall be dismayed, that man may be removed from the mountain of Esau. On account of the impious slaughter of thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off forever. From the day that thou didst become an adversary, whenever the Philistines captivated his army, or strangers entered his gates and cast lots on Jerusalem, thou also wast as one of them. But thou shouldst not have looked on thy brother's day in the day of strangers; nor rejoiced over the children of Juda, in the day of their de-
struction; nor shouldst thou have vaunted in the day of affliction; nor entered people's gates in the day of their distresses.

13 Thou especially shouldst not have beheld their congregation in the day of their destruction, nor joined to fall on their army

14 in the day of their defeat; nor beset the passes to cut off such of them as were escaping; nor shouldst thou have hemmed

15 in his fugitives, in a calamitous day. Because the day of the Lord, against all the nations is near; as thou hast done so shall it be done to thee: thy dealings shall be returned on thy head.

16 For in the same manner as thou hast drunk on my holy mountain, all the nations shall be drunk up as wine. They shall be drunk up and swallowed down, and be as if they had never been. But on mount Sion shall be safety and a sanctuary; and

18 the house of Jacob shall possess those who possessed them; and the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph, a flame; and the house of Esau shall be as stubble; and upon these they shall kindle and consume them, so that there shall not be a torch bearer to the house of Esau. For the Lord

19 hath spoken. And they in Nageb shall inherit the mountain of Esau; and those in Sephale shall inherit the Philistines.—and they shall possess mount Ephraim and the plain of Samaria and Benjamin and Galaaditis; and this shall be the dominion of the captivity—to the Israelites shall belong the land of the Chananites to Sarepta, and to the captives of Jerusalem, to Ephratha: they shall possess the cities of Nageb.

21 And they who have been preserved, shall go up from mount Sion to execute vengeance on the mountain of Esau. And the kingdom shall be the Lord's.

JONAS.

I. When a word of the Lord came to Jonas the son of Amathi, saying, "Arise and go to Ninive that great city and proclaim in it, That the cry of its wickedness is come up to me." Jonas arose to flee to Tharsis from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Joppa, and finding a ship bound to Tharsis, he paid his fare and went on board with a design to sail with them to Tharsis, from the presence of the Lord.

4 But the Lord raised a wind on the sea, and there was a great
tempest in the sea, so that the ship was in danger of founder. And the mariners were terrified, and cried every one to his god, and threw overboard some of the cargo, to lighten the vessel. Now Jonas had gone down into the ship's hold, and was asleep and snoring. And the master of the ship came to him and said to him, What! art thou snoring? Arise and call on thy God, that thy God may save us, and that we may not perish. Then they said, one to another, Come let us cast lots and know on whose account this calamity is come on us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas. Whereupon they said to him, Tell us. What is thy business? And whence comest thou? And of what country, and of what people art thou? And he said to them, I am a servant of the Lord; and I worship the Lord God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land. Upon this the men were greatly terrified and said to him, Why hast thou done this? (For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, for he had told them.) Then they said to him, What shall we do to thee that the sea may be calmed for us? For the sea rolled and grew more and more tempestuous. And Jonas said to them, Take me up and throw me into the sea, and the sea will be calm for you; for I know that on my account this great tempest is come upon you. When the men had laboured hard to reach land, but could not because the sea ran high, and grew more tempestuous against them, then they cried to the Lord and said, Forbid it, O Lord, that we perish, for the life of this man, and bring not upon us innocent blood; for thou, O Lord, hast done according to thy pleasure. Then they took Jonas and cast him into the sea. Whereupon from raging the sea became still. And the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows.

Now the Lord had commanded a great fish to swallow Jonas, so Jonas was three days and three nights, in the belly of the fish. And when out of the belly of the great fish, Jonas prayed to the Lord his God, and said, In my affliction I cried to the Lord my God, and he hearkened to me: thou didst hear my cry from the womb of Hades: thou didst hearken to my prayer: thou hast cast me into the depths of
the heart of the sea. When streams encompassed me—all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. Then I said, I am cast out from thy sight; nevertheless I will continue to look towards thy holy temple. The water was poured around me to my soul; and the lowest abyss encompassed me; my head hath gone down into the clefts of mountains; I have gone down to a land, the bars of which are everlastingly fixed: let my soul now, corrupted as it is, ascend, O Lord, my God. When my soul was fainting I remembered the Lord; let my prayer now come to thee into thy holy temple. They who worship vanities and lies have forsaken their mercy: But I will sacrifice to thee with the voice of praise and thanksgiving. I will pay thee what I have vowed to the Lord for my deliverance.

Upon this a command was given by the Lord to the fish, and it cast forth Jonas upon the dry ground.

III. Then a word of the Lord came to Jonas a second time saying, "Arise and go to Ninive that great city, and proclaim in it according to the former proclamation which I spoke to thee." So Jonas arose and went to Ninive as the Lord had spoken. Now Ninive was an exceeding great city, of about three days' journey. And Jonas began at his entering the city, and for about one day's journey cried with a loud voice and said, "Yet three days and Ninive shall be destroyed." And the men of Ninive believed God and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least. When the word reached the king of Ninive, he arose from his throne and stripped off his robes and clothed himself with sackcloth and sat in ashes. And proclamation was made and orders issued in Ninive from the king and from his nobles, saying, With regard to men and beasts, including herds and flocks, Let them not taste any thing; let them neither feed nor drink water. So both men and beasts were covered with sackcloth; and there was an incessant cry to God; and every one turned from his evil way, and from the wickedness of their hands, saying, Who knoweth but God will relent and turn away from his fierce wrath, so that we may not perish. And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil ways. And God relented at the evil which he said he would do to them, and did it not.
IV. Thereupon Jonas was exceedingly grieved and confounded, and he prayed to the Lord and said, O Lord were not these my words, when I was yet in my own country? For which cause I attempted to flee to Tharsis. For I knew that thou art compassionate and merciful, long suffering and abundant in kind-ness and rekestest at evils. Now, therefore, O Sovereign Lord, take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.

And the Lord said to Jonas, Art thou very sorry—(Now Jonas had gone out of the city and sat over against it, and had made for himself a booth and sat under it until he should see what would befall the city. And the Lord had given orders to a colocynthis, and it had sprung up over the head of Jonas to be a shade over his head to shade him on account of his sufferings; and Jonas was exceeding glad of the colocynthis. But early the next morning God gave orders to a worm and it smote the colocynthis and it withered. And when the sun rose God ordered a burning wind to spring up and the sun beat upon Jonas' head so that he became fainty and abandoned himself to despair and said, It is better for me to die than to live. And God said to Jonas, Art thou very sorry) for the colocynthis. And he said I am sorry even to death. Thereupon the Lord said, Thou hast compassion for the colocynthis, for which thou hast not toiled and which thou hast not nourished, which sprang up in a night and perished in a night. And shall not I have compassion on Ninive this great city, in which there are more than one hundred and twenty thousand of the human species, who know not their right hand and their left; and also much cattle.

MICAH.

1. (p) A word of the Lord came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Joatham and Achaz and Ezekias kings of Judah; with regard to those things which he saw touching Samaria and touching Jerusalem, Hear, O peoples, words! and let this land attend and all who are in it. And let the Lord, Lord among you be a witness—the Lord from his holy temple. For behold the Lord is coming forth from his place; and he will come down and walk on the heights of this land; and under
him the mountains will tremble, and the vallies shall melt like wax before fire, and be like water rolling down a precipice.

5 (J) All this is on account of the impiety of Jacob, and for the sin of the house of Israel. What is the impiety of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what is the sin of the house of Juda? Is it not Jerusalem? Therefore I will make Samaria like a hut of a field and like a plant of a vineyard, and I will drag the stones thereof into a ditch and lay her foundations bare. And all her graven images shall be hack'd to pieces; and all her earnings shall be burned with fire; and all her idols I will utterly destroy.

Because from the earnings of fornication she collected, and from the earnings of fornication, amassed; therefore she shall wail and utter lamentations: she shall walk barefoot and naked; she shall utter a wailing like that of jackals; and moanings like the daughters of the ostrich.

9 Because her wound is large; because it hath come even to Juda and reached the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem; magnify not yourselves ye men of Gath, and ye Enakims, rebuild not from a house, in derision. According to your derision you shall sprinkle yourselves with dust. Sennaar, who dwelt at ease in her cities, went not forth to bewail a neighbouring house; from you she shall receive a painful wound.

12 Who led the way to good for her who was dwelling in sorrows, because evils from the Lord, a sound of chariots and horsemen came down against the gates of Jerusalem? Was it the inhabitant of Lachis? She is a leader to sin for the daughter of Sion. Because in thee have been found the impieties of Israel, therefore even to the inheritance of Gath he will give up idolatrous houses as abandoned. To the kings of Israel they were of no avail. O inhabitant of Lachis! until the true heirs shall be brought in—O! Odollam! until an inheritance, the glory of the daughter of Israel shall come, shave thy locks and make thyself bald for thy delicate children; lengthen out thy widowhood like an eagle, for they shall be carried from thee into captivity.

II. They planned mischief; they contrived evils on their beds, and soon as it was day they executed them; for they did not lift up their hands to God. They coveted fields and plundered orphans and tyrannised over houses; they plundered a man and
3 his household—a man and his inheritance; therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold against this tribe I am planning evils, from which you shall not withdraw your necks, nor walk erect suddenly. Because it is an evil time, a parable will in that day be taken up against you, and a song of lamentation will be sung, saying, "With affliction we have been afflicted! the portion of my people hath been measured with a line, and there was none to hinder or turn it aside." Your fields have been parcelled out, therefore there shall be none to stretch a line for thee by lot, in the congregation of the Lord. Weep not bitterly, nor let tears be shed for these things, for reproaches will not be cast off even by him who saith, "The house of Israel hath provoked to wrath the spirit of the Lord. Are not these his purposes? Are not his words good with him? Have these walked in a straight course?" Indeed this people of mine have openly risen up for enmity. In direct opposition to his peace they have even stripped off his skin, that the extreme horror of war might destroy hope.

9 The leaders of my people shall be hurled from their houses of pleasure; for their wicked devices they have been expelled; draw ye near to the everlasting mountains. Arise and depart, for this is not a rest for thee. By reason of impurity you are utterly corrupted: you have been put to flight when there was no pursuer: a spirit hath set up a lie: it hath dropped on thee for wine and plenty. Yet it shall come to pass that from a drop of this people, Jacob with all his sons shall be gathered together. With expectation I will expect the remnant of Israel. I will place together them who are about to return. Like sheep in distress, like a flock in their fold, they shall rush out from among men through a breach before them. They have broken through and passed the gate; they are gone through it and their king is gone out before them; and the Lord will be their leader, and he will say,

III. Hear these things ye children of the house of Jacob, and ye remnant of the house of Israel, is it not your business to know judgment? As for them who hate good and seek evil, who tear off the skin from these and the flesh from their bones: as they have devoured the flesh of my people and have flayed off their skin from them; and have broken their bones and
chopped them up, as flesh for a kettle and as pieces of meat for a pot: so they shall cry to the Lord but he will not hearken to them; but will turn away his face from them at that time, because by their devices they have committed evil against these.

II. THUS saith the Lord against the prophets who led my people astray, who gnash with their teeth and proclaim peace for them, though it was not put in their mouths; they have raised up war against them. Therefore from vision you shall have night; and from prophesying you shall have darkness. And the sun shall set upon the prophets, and upon them the day shall darken: and the seers of dreams shall be put to shame; and the diviners shall be laughed to scorn, and reviled by all; for none will hearken to them. None but I can, by the spirit of the Lord, supply strength both of judgment and might to declare to Jacob his impiety and to Israel his sins.

(p) Hear these things I beseech you, ye leaders of the house of Jacob, and ye remnant of the house of Israel, who abhor judgment and pervert all equity, who are building up Sion with blood and Jerusalem with injustice.

(J) Her rulers have judged for rewards; and her priests have given answers for hire; and her prophets have prophesied for silver, without waiting for the Lord, saying, "Is not the Lord among us? No evils shall come upon us:" therefore because of you, Sion shall be ploughed like a field; and Jerusalem shall be like a temporary building for summer fruits; and the mountain of the house shall be for a grove of a forest.

IV. But it shall come to pass in the last of these days, that the mountain of the Lord shall be conspicuous; it shall be established on the tops of the mountains, and raised high above the hills; and peoples shall hasten to it. And many nations shall come—they will say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; that they may point out to us his ways, and that we may walk in his paths." For out of Sion shall go forth a law; and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he will judge among many peoples, and rebuke nations of extensive power. And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall no more lift up a sword against nation; nor shall
4 they any more learn to fight. But they shall rest every man under his own vine, and every man under his own fig tree; and there shall be none to make them afraid.

(p) Because the mouth of the Lord Almighty hath spoken these things—because all the people will walk every one in his own way, let us therefore walk in the name of the Lord our God until that age and beyond it.

(J) In that day, saith the Lord, I will gather her that hath been bruised; and take back her who was cast off and them whom I had put away: and I will make the bruised a remnant, and her who was put away, a mighty nation. And the Lord will reign over them on mount Sion henceforth and forever. And as for thee, thou squalid tower of a flock, thou daughter of Sion; to thee he will come, when the chiefdom, the first royal government shall have come from Babylon for the daughter of Jerusalem. Now therefore why hast thou known evils? Was there no king for thee? Or was thy counsel destroyed, that pangs of a woman in travail have seized thee? Be in pangs, but take courage and draw near to delivery, O daughter of Sion. For thou art now to go from a city and to make thy abode in a field, and go even to Babylon. Thence he will deliver thee; yes, thence the Lord thy God will redeem thee out of the hands of thine enemies. Now indeed many nations are assembled against thee, saying, "Let us rejoice exceedingly and let our eyes look upon Sion." But they did not know the determination of the Lord nor understand his counsel. Because he hath gathered them as sheaves for a threshing floor, arise daughter of Sion and tread them out. Because I will make thy horns iron and thy hoofs I will make brass; therefore thou shalt break many peoples in pieces, and devote the multitude of them to the Lord, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.

V. (p) Now shall a daughter be hedged in with a hedge. He hath ordered a siege against us.

(J) With a rod they will smite on the check the tribes of Israel. But as for thee, Bethlehem, thou house of Ephratha, art thou too little to be one of the chiliads of Juda? Out of thee one shall come forth for me to be the chief of Israel. His goings forth have been from the beginning—from the days of
3 an age. Therefore he will continue them till the time of one bringing forth. She shall bring forth and the rest of their bre-
4 thren shall turn to the children of Israel. And they will stand and look and the Lord will feed his flock with majesty; and in the glory of the name of the Lord their God they shall subsist; because they shall now be magnified to the ends of the earth; therefore she shall have peace.

5 As for Assur, when he hath come against your land, and when he
6 hath passed over your country; against him shall be raised up seven shepherds. And there shall be eight bites of men and they will feed Assur with a sword and the land of Nebrod in its enclosure. So he will deliver from the Assyrian, when he hath come
7 against your land and when he hath passed over your borders. And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations in the midst of many people, like dew falling from the Lord and like lambs upon the wilds.

8 That none may be ungathered or left behind among the children of men, the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among beasts of the forest, and like a young lion among flocks of sheep; so that when he passeth through and hath made a
9 choice, he may tear and there shall be none to deliver. Thy hand shall be raised up against them who afflict thee; and all
10 thine enemies shall be utterly cut off. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will destroy the horses from
11 the midst of thee and destroy thy chariots and I will root out
12 the cities of thy land and demolish thy fortifications. And I will cut off thy sorceries out of thy hands and in thee shall be
13 no diviners. And I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars from the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship
14 the works of thy hands. And I will cut down the groves from amidst thee and utterly destroy thy cities; and with indignation and with wrath I will execute vengeance among the nations because they have not hearkened.

VI. III. (p) HEAR, I beseech you, a word. The Lord, Lord, hath commanded.
    (J) Arise; come to judgment before the mountains; and let the hills hear thy voice!
    2 (p) Hear ye mountains the controversy of the Lord! And
ye vallies the foundations of the earth! For the Lord hath a controversy with his people, and with Israel he will plead. O my people, what have I done to thee? Or wherein have I grieved thee? Or what molestation have I given thee? Answer me. For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, and sent before thee Moses and Aaron and Mariam. O my people call now to remembrance what counsel Balak king of Moab took against thee; and what answer was made him by Balaam son of Beor, That from Schoinon the righteousness of the Lord may be made known to Galgal.

(Balak.) "By what mean shall I gain over the Lord? Shall I take him for my God most high? Shall I gain him over by whole burnt offerings—by calves of a year old? Will the Lord accept me for thousands of rams or myriads of fat goats? Must I give my first born for iniquity—the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul."

(Balaam.) "Must thou, O man, be told what is good? What doth the Lord require from thee, but to do justice and to love mercy, and to be prepared to walk with the Lord thy God?"

(p) Let the voice of the Lord be proclaimed in the city and it will save them who fear his name.

(J) Hear, O tribe! Who is the man that will adorn a city? Will fire and the house of an unrighteous man [do it?] Or he who is treasuring up unlawful treasures and iniquities with haughtiness? Will an unrighteous man be justified by a balance, or false weights by a bag with which they have increased their wicked wealth? As they who inhabit it have spoken lies and their tongue hath been exalted in their mouth; therefore I will begin with smiting thee—I will make thee desolate for thy sins. Thou shalt eat but shalt not be satisfied. Though darkness come and warn thee thou shalt not escape; and if any escape, to the sword they shall be delivered up. Thou shalt sow but thou shalt not reap. Thou shalt press the olive, but shalt not anoint thyself with oil. You shall make wine, but shall not drink it. And the ritual services of my people shall be utterly destroyed. As thou hast kept the statutes of Zambri, and all the works of the house of Achab; and you have walked in their ways, that I might deliver thee up to desola-
tion, and the inhabitants of this city to hissing; therefore you shall bear the reproaches of peoples.

VII. (p) Woe is me! for I am like one picking up stalks in harvest, and like one gathering a gleaning at the vintage? Not a bunch of the first fruits is left for me to eat. Ah woe is my life, that the pious is perished from the land, and among men there is not an upright man left!

(J) They are all indicted for capital crimes: they grievously afflict every man his neighbour: they are preparing their hands for evil. The chief asketh and the judge hath spoken words of peace! He is entirely at his devotion; therefore I will take away their good things, like a consuming moth advancing regularly in the day of visitation.

(p) Alas! alas! thy punishments are come; now will their lamentations be—"Trust not in friends, nor confide in rulers, against the wife of thy bosom be on thy guard—to trust nothing to her: for a son dishonoureth a father; a daughter will rise up against her mother; a daughter in law against her mother in law; all a man's household are his enemies."

(c) But as for me I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God who is my saviour; he who is my God will hearken to me. Rejoice not over me, O mine enemy, because I have fallen. I shall rise again, for though I sit in darkness the Lord will give me light. I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him; until he vindicate my cause. He will do me justice and bring me out into light; and shame shall cover her who saith, "Where is thy God?" Mine eyes shall see her. She shall now be trodden down like dirt in the streets.

(J) The day for anointing a plinth—that day will be the unanointing of thee, that day will indeed destroy thy ritual services. And thy cities shall become plains and be distributed among the Assyrians: even thy fortified cities shall be for distribution, from Tyre to the river and from sea to sea, and from mountain to the mountain. And the land shall be for desolation with them who inhabit it, for the fruits of their devices.

(c) The chorus, or Sion.
14 (p) Feed thou thy people with thy crook—the flock of thy heritage—them who are by themselves in a forest in the midst of yonder Carmel.

(J) They shall feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. And as in the days of thy coming out of Egypt, you shall see wonderful things. Nations shall see and be confounded, and because of all the mighty power of these, they will lay their hands on their mouths. Their ears will be stopped. They will lick dust like serpents trailing on the ground; they will be confounded in their enclosure.

18 (p) At the Lord our God let them be confounded and struck with terror because of thee. Who is a God like unto thee, taking away iniquities, and passing by the transgressions of the remnant of his heritage? He hath not kept his anger in remembrance; because he delighteth in mercy; he will turn and have compassion on us: he will bury deep our iniquities; they shall be whelmed in the depths of the sea. All our sins he will give up for truth to Jacob, as an act of mercy to Abraham as he sware to our fathers, according to the days which have been heretofore.

NAHUM.

The sentence on Ninive.

I. The book of the vision of Nahum, the Elkosite.

1 God is zealous. The Lord is about to take vengeance:
2 the Lord is about to take vengeance with wrath: the Lord is about to take vengeance on his adversaries, and to destroy utterly his enemies, himself.
3 (a) The Lord is slow to anger, though his power is great; will not the Lord then acquit the innocent? Is his way in destruction and whirlwind, when clouds are the dust of his feet?
4 When he rebuketh the sea he maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel are diminished and the bloom

(a) An objection. (b) The answer.
5 of Libanus languisheth. At him the mountains quake and the hills tremble: at his presence the earth is startled—the world and all its inhabitants. At the presence of his wrath who can stand, or who can resist his fierce indignation? His wrath dissolveth governments, and by him the rocks are rent to pieces.

7 (b) The Lord is kind to them who wait for him in a day of distress: and he knoweth them who reverence him.

8 When with a deluging march he maketh destruction; them who raise themselves up and are his enemies, darkness shall pursue.

9 What are you devising against the Lord? He will make complete destruction, and not punish twice by distress for the same thing. Because one shall be utterly destroyed, and consumed like bindweed and dry stubble; shall a reasoning against the Lord proceed from thee, O wicked city, devising things in opposition? Thus saith the Lord, With respect to the ruler of many waters! they shall be so dispersed, that what thou hearrest shall be heard no more. I will now break his sceptre from thee, and burst the bands asunder. Concerning thee the Lord will command, let none of thy name be sown any more. From the house of thy God I will root out the graven and molten images; "I will make it a sepulchre for thee."

15 (p) Because yonder on the mountain are the swift feet of one bringing good news—even of one announcing peace; O Juda, solemnize thy festivals; pay thy vows; for they shall no more proceed to pass through thee for conflict. It is completely laid waste, entirely removed.

II. Into thy presence came up panting one who is delivered from affliction. Watch the way; strengthen thy loins; act manfully with all thy might, since the Lord hath averted contumely from Jacob, as he did reproach from Israel, since emptiers have emptied them out and destroyed their branches—the instruments of their tyranny from among men—their mighty men insulting with fire. In the day of his preparation the reins of their chariots, and the horsemen will be disordered in their ranks; and the chariots will justle together and be entangled with one another in the streets. The appearance of them is like flaming
5 torches and like streamy lightning. Their grandees will recollect and flee by day; but they shall be weak in their march. While they shall be hasting to her walls, and preparing their out guards; the gates of the cities are opened, and the palaces are fallen. And the empress herself is exposed to view; even she herself is gone up, and her maids are led along cooing plaintively like doves, in their hearts. As for Ninive, her waters are like a standing pool. They who fled away made no halt, nor was there one who looked back. They plundered the silver; they plundered the gold; but of her furniture there was no end; every one is loaded with her precious utensils.

10 What quaking and driving! what groans and heart breaking! what feebleness of knees and pangs in every loin! what blackness, like that of a pot, on the countenance of all! where is the habitation of the lions, and the feeding places of the young lions? Where had the old lions gone, that a young lion entered and there was none to scare him? The old lion had seized enough for his whelps, and had strangled for his lionesses, and had filled his hole with prey, and his den with ravin:

13 behold I am against thee saith the Lord Almighty, and I will burn out thy multitude with smoke; and a sword shall devour thy lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth; and of thy deeds nothing more shall be heard.

III. O bloody city, wholly perfidious and full of lies! shall not thy prey be handled? A sound of whips! and the sound of the rumbling of wheels, and of the pursuing horse! and bounding chariot! and of the cavalry advancing! and of the glittering sword and gleamy arms! and of the multitude of wounded! and of the hideous crash! Though there was no bound to her nations, they shall be weak of body by reason of great fornication.

4 O fair harlot and bewitching mistress of sorceries, who sellest nations by thy whoredom, and peoples by thy sorceries! behold I am against thee, saith the Lord God Almighty, and I will expose thy skirts to view; and shew nations thy shame; and kingdoms, thy dishonour: and cast abomination on thee according to thine impurities; and make thee a publick example, so that every one who seeth thee shall go down from thee, and say, Wretched Ninive! who can bemoan her? Whence can I find comfort for her?
8 Prepare a funeral cake! attune the lyre! prepare the funeral cake of Ammon! she dwelt among rivers; water was around her.
9 The sea was her dominions, and water, her walls, and Ethiopia and Egypt, her strength; and the end of her flight was not stopped and the Lybians were her auxiliaries. Yet she is to go captive into banishment; and her infants shall be dashed to the ground at the head of all the streets; and for all her splendid treasures lots shall be cast; and all her grandees shall be bound with fetters. And as for thee thou shalt be made drunk and be despised, and shalt seek for thyself a resting place from enemies. All thy fortresses are like figs which have watchers;
13 when shaken they will fall into the mouth of the eater. Behold thy people in thee are like women; the gates of thy land shall be opened wide to thine enemies; a fire shall utterly devour thy bars. Draw thee water for a siege, and fortify thy bulwarks. Go down into the clay, and let him be trampled with straw. Make it harder than any brick. There a fire shall devour thee; a sword shall cut thee off. Like a locust it will devour thee; and like a brouchus locust thou shalt be afflicted.
16 Thou hast multiplied thy merchandise, above the stars of heaven; the brouchus came rushing on, and is flown. Thy merchandise is swept away like the attelebos locust—like the small locust mounted on a hedge, in a cold day: the sun broke out and they are swept away, and their place is not known.
18 Alas for them! thy shepherds slumbered; an Assyrian king lulled to sleep thy mighty men: thy people fled to the mountains and there was none to rally them. There is no cure for thy bruise. Thy wound is festered. All that hear the news of thee will clap their hands at thee. For upon whom hath not thy wickedness come continually?

AMBAKUM OR HABAKKUK.

The vision which Ambakum the prophet saw.

2 (p) How long, O Lord shall I cry, and thou not hearken? How long shall I being injured cry to thee, and thou not save?
3 Why hast thou pointed out to me to behold labours and sor-
rows, misery and impiety? A suit is instituted against me and the judge receiveth [bribes] therefore law is disregarded and the cause is not brought to an issue. Because a wicked man oppresseth the just, therefore wrong judgment will be given.

5 (J) See ye despisers! and view intently and be amazed at wonderful things and vanish. For in your days I am doing a work which you will not believe though one tell you.

6 For lo! I am raising up the Chaldeans that bitter and hasty nation, which marcheth over the breadth of the earth, to possess dwellings which belong not to them. He is terrible and illustrious; his judgment will be from himself, and from himself his prophesy will proceed. His horses can out leap leopards and are swifter than the lynxes of Arabia. When his horsemen have mounted, they will rush impetuously from afar, and will fly like an eagle, eager for prey. Destruction will come on the wicked who set themselves against him; and he will gather captives like the sand. He indeed will riot in kings; and petty princes will be his scorn. Of every fortress he will make a scoff and will raise a mount and take it. Then he will change his mind and depart and be pacified.

12 (p) This is the majesty which belongeth to my God. Art not thou from everlasting? O Lord, my God, my Holy One! let us not die. Thou, O Lord, hast appointed this for judgment: and formed it that its correction may work conviction in me. Thine eye is too pure to behold wicked deeds, or to look on the labours of sorrow. Why lookest thou upon despisers? Wilt thou be silent when the wicked swallow up the righteous? Wilt thou make these men like the fishes of the sea, and like those reptiles which have no leader? He hath drawn up destruction with a hook, and hath dragged out one with a dredge, and enclosed another with his sweep net. For this cause he will rejoice and his heart will be glad; therefore he will sacrifice to his net and burn incense to his dredge. Because by these he made his mess rich and his food delicious, shall he on the account of this cast his dredge, and not spare to slay nations continually?

II I will stand on my watch and go up upon a rock and look around, that I may see what he will say to me and what
answer I shall receive to my expostulation. And the Lord answered and said,

(J) Write a vision: write it distinctly in a book that the reader may trace these things; for the vision is for a time yet to come. But it will spring up at last and will not be vain. Though he may tarry, wait for him; for he will assuredly come and will not fail. If any one draw back my soul hath no pleasure in him. But the just shall live by faith in me.

Now this arrogant and contemptuous man—this man of boasts shall not exceed a certain bound. He enlarged his soul like Hades and like death was not satisfied. When he shall have gathered to him all the nations and received for himself all the peoples, will they not all take up a parable against him and a fable to tell of him, saying, Wo to him who is heaping up for himself things which do not belong to him? For how long? And making his yoke grievously heavy. For biters of him shall start up suddenly. And the plotters against thee shall be sober and thou shalt be plunder for them. Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the remaining peoples shall plunder thee for the blood of mankind, and for the impieties of a land and a city and of all them who inhabit it.

Wo to him who coveteth wicked gain for his house, that he may raise his nest high to be out of the reach of evils. Thou hast contrived shame for thy house; thou hast provoked many peoples and thy soul hath sinned; for a stone out of a wall will cry out, and a worm from a beam will proclaim these things.

Wo to him who buildeth a city with blood and furbisheth up a city with iniquities! Are not these things from the Lord Almighty? When many nations have fainted by fire, and many peoples have been dispirited, that the earth may be filled with a knowledge of the glory of God. Like water it will cover them.

Wo to him who maketh his neighbour drink a foamy intoxicating draught, making him drunk that he may inspect his caves. Because of thy glory drink thou also a full draught of dishonour, and be confounded at heart and shaken. The cup of the right hand of the Lord is come round to thee and dishonour is heaped upon thy glory. For the impiety at Libanus
shall cover thee and the sufferings of wild beasts shall terrify thee, on the account of the blood of mankind, and for the wickedness of a land and a city and of all them who inhabit it.

18 Of what avail is a graven thing, that they have engraved it? Did one cause a molten mass, a false fantasy, to be cast, because the caster had a confidence that by casting he would make dumb idols? Wo to him who saith to wood, Awake; arise. And to stone, be thou exalted. The one is indeed a fantasy; and the other, a plating of gold and silver: there is no breath in it. But the Lord is in his holy temple. Let all the earth be awed at his presence.

III. The Prayer of Ambakum the prophet; with an Ode.

2 O Lord, I have heard the report of thee and am terrified; I have considered thy works and am struck with amaze. In the midst of two living beings thou wilt be known; when the years draw nigh thou wilt be acknowledged; when the time is come thou wilt be pointed out: when my soul is troubled, in wrath remember mercy. God will come from Thaiman, even the Holy One from the thick shady mountains of Pharan.

4 His glory obscured the heavens; and the earth was full of his praise. His splendor will be like light—beaming rays in his hands, which impressed a lasting love of his Majesty.

5 Before him Logos [the word] will march, and advance into the plain. He stood and the earth was shaken: he looked, and nations melted away: the mountains were violently convulsed,

7 the everlasting hills melted. Instead of labours I beheld his marches of old. The dwellings of the Ethiopians shall be terrified! And the tents of the land of Madian! Wast thou, O Lord, angry with the rivers? Or was thy wrath against the rivers? Or thine indignation against a sea, that thou shouldst mount thy horses? Thy riding is indeed salvation. Thou hast bent thy bow effectually against sceptres. The Lord saith, "The land of rivers shall be broken; peoples shall see and be in pangs." Thou art scattering the rolling waters. The deep roar-

11 ed. It swelled high. The sun was withdrawn: and the moon stood on its orbit. Thy bolts will glance for light, for a glare of the lightening of thine arms. With a threat thou canst dimi-
13 nish a land, and with wrath crush nations. Thou hast marched forth for the salvation of thy people, to save thine anointed One. Thou wilt pour death on the head of transgressors, thou
14 hast raised chains up to the neck. Thou hast struck with consternation the heads of mighties, at this they will be appalled! They will slacken their reins and be like a poor man eating
15 in secret, whilst thou art pressing into the sea thy horses ruffling a mighty water.
16 I watched myself; and at the sound of the prayer of my lips my bowels trembled and a tremor seized my bones; and under me my whole frame quivered. I shall be at rest in the day of affliction, at the time of his coming to the people of
17 my neighbourhood. Since the fig tree will not flourish, nor will there be fruit on the vines; the product of the olive will fail, and the fields will supply no food—For want of food the flocks
18 have failed, and there are no kine in the stalls; As for me, I will rejoice in the Lord; I shall have joy for God my saviour.
19 The Lord God is my strength, and will guide my feet to the end. He maketh me walk in high places; that I may triumph with his song.

SOPHONIAS.

I. THE word of the Lord which came to Sophonias the Chusite, the son of Godolias son of Amorias, son of Ezekias in the days of Josias son of Amos king of Juda.
2 Let there be a total failure from the face of this land, saith the Lord. Let man and beast perish. Let the birds of the air and the fishes of the sea perish. As for the wicked, they shall be without strength; and I will remove transgressions from the
4 face of this land, saith the Lord. I will indeed stretch forth my hand against Juda, and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will remove out of this place the names of Baal and
5 the names of her priests; and them who worship the host of heaven on the house tops—both those worshippers and them also who swear by the Lord and who swear also by their king; and them who turn aside from the Lord, and them who seek not the Lord, and them who cleave not to him. Be struck with awe, at the presence of the Lord God, for the day of the Lord
is near at hand. Because the Lord hath prepared his sacrifice and hallowed his guests; therefore it shall come to pass in the day of the sacrifice of the Lord, that I will execute vengeance on the chiefs and on the house of the king, and on all them who are clothed with strange apparel. And I will punish publicly before the gates, on that day, them who fill the house of the Lord their God with impiety and deceit. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that there shall be a sound of shouting from the gate of the warriors, and a doleful lamentation from the second gate, and a great crashing from the hills.

Raise the song of woe, ye who inhabit the stormed city; because all the people are like Chanaan. And they who were elated with silver are to be all cut off. Therefore it shall come to pass in that day, that I will search Jerusalem with a lamp, and execute vengeance on the men who are despisers—upon their stores. And as for them who say in their hearts, "The Lord will neither do good nor harm," their wealth shall be for plunder; and their houses, for desolation. Though they build houses, they shall not inhabit them; and though they plant vineyards; they shall not drink the wine thereof; because the great day of the Lord is near—is near and hasting with great speed. The sound of the day of the Lord is bitter, and dreadful things are ordained: that day will be a mighty day of wrath; a day of tribulation and distress: a day of wasting and desolation; a day of gloom and darkness; a day of clouds and thick darkness; a day of the trumpet and shouting against the fortified cities and against the lofty towers. And I will bring distress upon the men and they shall walk as if blind. Because they have sinned against the Lord, therefore he will pour out their blood like dust and their flesh as dung. And their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them, in the day of the indignation of the Lord. By the fire of his zeal the whole land shall be consumed, for he will bring speedy destruction on all the inhabitants of this land.

Assemble and make joint supplication, O unimproved nation, before you become like a flitting flower—before the wrath of the Lord come upon you—before the day of the fierce anger of the Lord reach you. Seek the Lord all ye meek of the land; exercise judgment and seek righteousness, and live an-
swerably; that you may be sheltered in the day of the anger of the Lord. For Gaza shall be plundered and Ascalon shall be a waste; and Azotus shall be driven out at noon day; and Accaron shall be rooted out.

(J) Alas for them who inhabit the sea coast—the emigrants from Crete! a word of the Lord is against you in Chanaan, the land of the Philistines, and I will destroy you from your habitations. And Crete shall be a pasture for flocks and a fold for sheep; and the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Juda. They shall feed upon them. In the houses of Ascalon they will lie down in the evening for fear of the children of Juda. Because the Lord their God hath visited them; therefore he will bring back their captivity. I have heard the revilings of Moab and the buffets of the children of Ammon, with which they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against my borders: therefore as I live, saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab shall be like Sodom and the children of Ammon like Gomorra; and Damascus shall be left like the heap of a winnowing floor, and shall be desolate forever, that the remnant of my people may spoil them: and the remains of my nation shall inherit them. This they shall have for their haughtiness, and their reproaches and for magnifying themselves against the Lord Almighty. The Lord will display himself illustriously against them, and will root out all the gods of the nations of the earth, and all the isles of the nations shall worship him, every one from his place—even you Ethiopians are the victims of my sword. And he will stretch forth his hand against the north, and destroy the Assyrian and make Ninive a desolation—dry as a desert: and in the midst of it flocks shall feed and all the wild beasts of the land. In its stalls the chameleons and porcupines shall make their beds; and wild beasts shall utter their voice in its vaults, and ravens in its gates; for a cedar is the only relict of it. This is the scornful city which dwelleth securely, which saith in her heart, "I am and there is none besides me. How it is become a desolation, the haunt of wild beasts! Every one who passeth through it will express his pity and shake his hands.

(p) Oh! the illustrious and redeemed city! This dove hearkened not to a voice. She received not instruction: she trusted not in the Lord; nor did she draw near to her God: her
3 chiefs within her were like roaring lions, and her judges like the wolves of Arabia. They left nothing for the morning: her prophets are enthusiasts, arrogant men: her priests profane the holies and unhallow the law: But the righteous Lord is in the midst of her and will not do an unjust thing. Every morning he will bring his judgment to light; for it was not hidden; nor did he countenance injustice for solicitation, nor make injustice successful.

6 (J) With destruction I drag'd down the proud. Their towers were made desolate. I will make their highways entirely waste, that none may travel them. Their cities are destroyed so that there is not a man—not an inhabitant. I have spoken. Nevertheless fear me, and receive instruction and you shall not be cut off out of her sight. All that I have inflicted on her, repair thou. Arise betimes.

8 (p) All the gleanings of them are spoiled.
(J) On that very account, wait thou for me, saith the Lord, until the day of my resurrection for a testimony. For this judgment of mine is for the assemblies of nations; to admit kings, to pour out all the fury of my wrath on them. For by the fire of my zeal all this land shall be utterly destroyed, that I may then bring back upon peoples a tongue for its generation, that they may all invoke the name of the Lord—that they may serve him under one yoke. From the ends of the rivers of Ethiopia I will expect them; among my dispersed they shall bring sacrifices for me. In that day thou shalt not be put to shame for all thy devices, which thou hast impiously devised against me; because I will then take away from thee those trifles which occasion thy haughtiness, that thou mayst no more continue to boast of my holy mountain; and I will then expect in thee a meek and lowly people; and the remnant of Israel will revere the name of the Lord, and no more commit iniquity, nor speak vain things; nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth.

(p) Because they shall feed and lie down and there shall be none to make them afraid. Rejoice, O daughters of Sion, Make proclamation, O daughters of Jerusalem! Be glad and rejoice with thy whole heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. The Lord hath taken away thy transgressions: he hath redeemed
thee out of the hand of thine enemies. The king of Israel—the Lord is in the midst of thee; thou shalt no more see evils.

16 At that time the Lord will say to Jerusalem, "Take courage, Sion. Let not thy hands hang down. The Lord thy God is with thee. The Mighty one will save thee. He will bring thee gladness and renew thee in his love; and rejoice over thee with joy as in the day of a festival; when I have gathered those of you who have been bruised."

(J) Ha! who is this that hath taken up a reproach against her? Behold here am I—I am dealing with thee for thy sake at that time, saith the Lord, and I will save her who hath been trodden down; and take back her who hath been put away; and I will make them a boast and renowned in every land.

20 And they shall be ashamed at that time when I deal kindly with you. Even at the time when I take you back. For I will make you renowned and a boast among all the people of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before their eyes, saith the Lord.

HAGGAI.

I. IN the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, a word of the Lord came by the ministry of Haggai the prophet, saying,

Say to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel of the tribe of Juda,
2 and to Jesus the son of Josedek the high priest, these words:
Thus saith the Lord Almighty, This people say, The time is not come to build the house of the Lord. Now a word of the Lord is come by the ministry of Haggai the prophet, saying, Is it indeed time for you to dwell in your cielèd houses, whilst this house of ours is lying waste? Now therefore thus saith the Lord Almighty, Turn your thoughts on your ways. You have sown much and gathered little. You have eaten but have not had enough. You have drunk, but not plentifully; you have clothed yourselves, but have not been warmed. And he who earned wages put it in a bag with holes. Thus saith the Lord Almighty apply your thoughts to these ways of yours: Go up to the mountain and cut timber. Build this house that I may take pleasure in it and be glorified, saith the Lord. You have
looked for much, but little came; and when it was brought home I blowed upon it on this account, saith the Lord, because my house is waste and you attend every one to his own house; therefore the heaven shall refrain from dew and the earth shall withhold her products; and I will bring a sword on this land and on the mountains, and on the corn, and on the wine, and on the oil even on all that the earth produceth, and on the men and on the cattle and on all the labours of their hands.

Thereupon Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and Jesus the son of Josedek the high priest, and all the remnant of the people hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God and to the words of the prophet Haggai, as the Lord their God had sent him to them. And when the people were terrified at the presence of the Lord, then Haggai, a messenger of the Lord among the messengers of the Lord to the people, said, "I am with you saith the Lord." And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zorobabel the son of Salathiel of the tribe of Juda, and the spirit of Jesus the son of Josedek the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people and they went and worked at the house of the Lord Almighty their God on the four and twentieth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the king.

In the seventh month, on the twenty first day of the month, the Lord spoke by the ministry of Haggai the prophet, saying, Speak now to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel of the tribe of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedek the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, saying, Is there any of you who hath seen this house in its former glory? How then must you look upon this now as a mere nothing before you! But be strong now Zorobabel, saith the Lord; and be strong, Jesus son of Josedek the high priest; and be strong all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you saith the Lord Almighty, and my spirit is in the midst of you. Be of good courage; for thus saith the Lord Almighty, Yet once more, I will shake the heaven and the earth including the sea and dry land, and I will convulse all the nations; and the choice things of all the nations will come, and I will fill this very house with glory, saith the Lord Almighty. The silver is mine and the gold is mine, saith the Lord Almighty. Because
the glory of this house shall be great, the latter greater than the first, saith the Lord Almighty; therefore in this very place I will give peace, saith the Lord Almighty—even peace of mind for a possession to every one active in again raising up this temple.

On the twenty fourth of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, a word of the Lord came to Haggai the prophet, saying, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Ask the priests the law, saying, If a man take holy flesh in the skirt of his mantle; and the skirt of his mantle touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any kind of food, will they be hallowed? And the priest in reply, said, No. Then Haggai said, If a polluted person—one who is unclean by a dead body touch any of these things will they be polluted? And the priests answered and said, They will be polluted. Thereupon Haggai said in reply, So is this people and so is this nation before me, saith the Lord: and so are all the works of their hands. And whoever shall come near there shall be polluted because of their morning burdens. Are they to be afflicted with grief on account of their toils? And have you hated a reposer in the gates? Recollect now, I beseech you, from that day back, before there was a stone laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord, What were ye? When you came to measure twenty measures of barley, it was become ten. And when you went to the wine lake to draw off fifty measures, there were only twenty. I smote you with blasting and mildew and hail in all the works of your hands when you turned not to me, saith the Lord. Turn now your thoughts from this day forward; from this twenty fourth of the ninth month: and from the day on which the foundation of the house of the Lord is laid, lay up in your minds whether that will be the case in the threshing floor? whether the vine or the fig tree or the pomegranate or the olive tree will any more be unproductive? From this very day I will bless.

Moreover a word of the Lord came a second time to Haggai the prophet on the twenty fourth day of the month, saying, Say to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel of the tribe of Juda—Say, "I will shake the heaven and the earth including the sea and the dry land, and I will overthrow the thrones of kings and destroy the power of the kings of the nations: and I will over-
throw the chariots and the charioteers; and horses and their riders shall come down every one with a sword against his brother. On that day, saith the Lord Almighty, I will take thee Zorobabel the son of Salathiel my servant, saith the Lord, and make thee a signet, because I have chosen thee, saith the Lord Almighty.

ZACHARIAS.

I. In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias the Barachite, the son of Addo the prophet, saying, The Lord was very angry with your fathers, therefore thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Turn to me, saith the Lord of Hosts and I will turn to you saith the Lord of Hosts. And be not like your fathers to whom the former prophets called, saying, "Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Turn from your evil ways and from your wicked devices," but they hearkened not, nor gave attention to listen to me, saith the Lord. As for your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, will they live forever? But receive ye my words and my statutes—all that I, by my spirit, give in charge to my servants the prophets, who reached your fathers, when they addressed them and said, "As the Lord Almighty determined to deal with us according to our ways, and according to our devices, so hath he dealt with us."

II. ON the twenty fourth of the eleventh month, which is the month Sabat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, the Barachite, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying—

(I had been viewing the night and lo! a man mounted on a red horse, and he stood between the shady mountains, and behind him were horses, red and ash coloured, and dappled and white. And I said, Lord what are these: and the angel who was talking with me said to me, I will shew thee what these are. Then the man who stood between the mountains, addressing me said, These are they whom the Lord sent to go round this land. Then they addressed the angel of the Lord who stood between the mountains, and said, We have gone round all this land, and lo all the land is inhabited, and quiet. And the angel of the Lord, answered and said, O Lord
Almighty, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, which thou hast overlooked those seventy years?
13 And the Lord Almighty answered the angel, who had been talking with me, with good determinations, and comfortable words. Whereupon the angel who had been talking with me said to me—He cried with a loud voice saying—)
15 Thus saith the Lord Almighty, I have been jealous of Jerusalem and Sion with great jealousy: and with great wrath I am angry with the nations who were set on. Because I was indeed a little displeased, but they were bent on mischief; therefore thus saith the Lord, I will turn to Jerusalem, with compassion and my house shall be rebuilded in it, saith the Lord Almighty, and a line shall be stretched on Jerusalem.
16 And again the angel who had been talking with me, said to me—Again he cried with a loud voice and said, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Again shall cities abound with prosperity. And again the Lord will compassionate Sion and make choice of Jerusalem.
18 Then I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and lo, four horns! and I said to the angel who was talking with me, Lord, what are these? And he said to me, These are the horns which have scattered Juda and Israel and Jerusalem. Then the Lord shewed me four carpenters. And I said, What are these going to do? And he said, Those four horns which scattered Juda and Israel are broken, and not one of them hath raised a head; now these are come to sharpen for themselves those four horns, namely the nations which lifted up a horn against the land of the Lord, to scatter it.

II.
2 Then I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and lo! a man with a measuring line in his hand! and I said to him, Whither art thou going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem to see how broad it is, and what is its length. Now behold the angel who had been talking with me had stopped—and another angel came out to meet him and spoke to him saying, "Run and speak to that young man and say," Jerusalem shall be crowded with inhabitants by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein. And I will be to her, saith the Lord, a wall of fire around; and I will be a glory in the midst of her.
6 O flee! flee from the land of the north, saith the Lord, for from the four winds of heaven I will gather you, saith the
7 Lord. To Sion make your escape, ye who inhabit the daughter of Babylon! for thus saith the Lord Almighty. He behind glory hath sent me against the nations which plundered you: 9 for he who toucheth you, is like one touching the apple of his eye. For behold I am bringing my hand upon them; and they shall be spoils for them who were their vassals: and you shall know that the Lord Almighty hath sent me.

10 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Sion! for lo! I am coming; and I will dwell amidst thee, saith the Lord; and many nations will flee to the Lord in that day, and be his people and dwell in the midst of thee; and thou shalt know that the Lord Almighty hath sent me to thee. And the Lord will settle Juda in his portion, in the holy land; and will again make choice of Jerusalem. Let all flesh be struck with awe, at the presence of the Lord, for he is risen up from his holy clouds.

III. Then the Lord shewed me Jesus the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan stood at his right hand to oppose him. And the Lord said to Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, Satan! even the Lord who hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee! lo! is not this like a brand snatched from fire? (Now Jesus was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel.) Then [the Lord] addressing them who stood before him, spoke, saying, Take away from him those filthy garments; (and to him he said, Behold I have taken away thy transgressions) and clothe ye him with a flowing robe and put on his head a clean mitre. And when they had put a clean mitre on his head and clothed him, then the angel of the Lord stood up. And the angel of the Lord protested to Jesus saying, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, If thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my statutes, thou shalt judge my house. And if thou wilt carefully watch my court I will give thee men conversant with these attendants.

8 Hearken now, O Jesus the high priest, thou and they near thee who sit in presence, since they are men who typify wonderful things: since lo! I am bringing my servant Anatole, 9 [the Day-spring;] since with regard to that stone which I have set before Jesus, upon that one stone there are seven eyes; behold I am digging a pit saith the Lord Almighty, 10 and I will feel all the iniquity of this land in one day. In that
day, saith the Lord Almighty, you will be inviting every one his neighbour under a vine, and under a fig tree.

IV. Then the angel who talked with me turned and roused me, as when a man is roused from his sleep, and said to me, what dost thou see? And I said, I have looked and lo! a candlestick all of gold with the lamp dish on the top of it; and seven lamps on the top of it; and seven pipes, for the seven lamps on the top of it; and two olive trees over it, one on the right of its lamp dish and the other on its left. Then I inquired and spoke to the angel who was talking with me, and said, Lord what are these? And the angel who was talking with me, answered and said to me, Dost thou not know what these are? When I said, No, lord. Then he answered and said to me, This is the word of the Lord to Zorobabel, saying,
    Not by mighty power nor by strength, but by my spirit saith the Lord Almighty. Who art thou; to complete this mountain—this great one—this before Zorobabel! I will indeed bring out the stone of the inheritance, an equality of favour, a free gift of it.
Then a word of the Lord came to me saying, The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall finish it: and thou shalt know, (since the Lord Almighty hath sent me to thee, since a certain person hath despised these as small days,) that those seven eyes will be gladdened, when they shall see the plumb-line in the hand of Zorobabel; they are the eyes which survey the whole earth.
Then I answered and said to him, What are those two olive trees which are on the right and left of the candlestick? And I inquired a second time and said to him, What are those two branches of the olive trees which are in the handles of those two funnels of gold, which are pouring into and supplying the golden pipes? And he said to me, Dost thou not know what these are? And when I said, No, lord. Then he said to me, These are the two sons of fatness. They stand before the Lord of the whole earth.

V. Then I turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked, and lo! a flying sickle. And he said to me, What dost thou see? And I said, I see a flying sickle twenty cubits long, and ten cubits broad. Whereupon he said to me, This is the curse
which is going forth over the face of the whole earth. Since every thief on the one hand is to be punished with death, and every false swearer on the other hand is to be punished; therefore I will bring it out saith the Lord Almighty; and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who sweareth by my name to a falsehood; and it shal lodge in his house, and destroy it with the timber and the stones thereof.

Then the angel who was talking with me went out and said to me, Look up with thine eyes and see this which is going out. And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the measure which is going away. Then he said, This is the iniquity of them in all this land. Then lo! a talent of lead was brought out; and lo! a woman was seated in the midst of the measure. And he said, This is the iniquity. Then he threw her down into the measure and he threw the mass of lead on her mouth. And I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and lo! two women came out, and there was a wind by their wings. Now they had the wings of a stork. And when they had lifted up the measure between heaven and earth, I said to the angel who was talking with me, Whither are they carrying the measure? And he said to me, To build a house for it in the land of Babylon and make preparation that they may place it there on its base.

Then I turned, and lifting up mine eyes I looked, and lo! four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of brass. In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot black horses, and in the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth chariot bay spotted horses. Whereupon addressing the angel who was speaking with me, I said, Lord, what are these? And the angel who was talking with me answered and said, These are the four winds of heaven. They are going out to wait on the Lord of the whole earth. That in which were the black horses went out to the land of the north; and the white went out after them; and the spotted went out to the land of the south; and the bay went out and looked with an intent to go round this land: and he said, Go and scour round this land. And when they had scoured round this land he cried aloud and spoke to me, say-
ing, Behold they who went to the land of the north have appeased my wrath in the land of the north.

9 Then a word of the Lord came to me, saying, Take the gifts of the captivity [which are coming] from their chiefs and from those who have been kind to the captives and from those who have taken notice of them; and on that same day thou shalt go to the house of Josias son of Sophonias who is coming from Babylon: and thou shalt take silver and gold and make crowns and put one on the head of Jesus the son of Josedek the high priest and say to him, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Behold a man! his name is Anatole [Day-spring] underneath him he shall spring up. And he shall build the house of the Lord. And he shall take authority and sit and rule on his throne; and there shall be a priest on his right hand; and there shall be a counsel of peace between both. And the crown shall be for them who wait, and for them who have been kind to the captives, and for them who have taken notice of them, as a token of the gratitude of the son of Sophonias, and as a psalm in the house of the Lord. And they who are far from them shall come and dwell in the house of the Lord; and you shall know, (since the Lord Almighty hath sent me to you,) that this indeed will come to pass, if you will hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord your God.

VII. III. AND it came to pass in the fourth year of Darius the king, that a word of the Lord came to Zacharias on the fourth of the ninth month which is Chaseneu. When the king and his men sent Sarasar and Arbeseer to Baithel to conciliate the favour of the Lord, saying to the priests who were at the house of the Lord Almighty, and saying to the prophets,

4 The dedication came hither in the fifth month as it hath done now for many years. Then a word of the Lord of hosts came to me saying, Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests, saying, Though you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months, lo! for seventy years; did you keep a fast for me? And though you ate and drank; did you not eat and drink for yourselves? Were not these the words which the Lord spake by the ministry of the prophets who were in former times when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity,
and the cities around her and the hilly country and the plain were inhabited? Then there was a word of the Lord to Zacharias, saying, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Execute just judgment and shew mercy and compassion one to another; and oppress not the widow, nor the orphan, nor the stranger, nor the poor; and let none treasure up in his heart for evil an injury done by his brother; but they refused to attend and turned back contemptuously; and stopped their ears that they might not hear; and made their heart disobedient that they might not hearken to my law; therefore (according to the words which the Lord Almighty by his spirit sent by the ministry of the former prophets) there was great wrath from the Lord Almighty; that it might come to pass as he said, "As they hearkened not, so they shall cry and I will not listen, saith the Lord Almighty, and I will cast them out into all the nations which they knew not; and the land behind them shall be a desolation, without a traveller and without a sojourner."

Now a word of the Lord Almighty is come saying,
Thus saith the Lord Almighty, I have had a great jealousy of Jerusalem and Sion, and with great wrath I have been jealous of her. But thus saith the Lord, I will return to Sion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the Lord Almighty, a holy mountain. Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Again old men and matrons shall sit in the streets of Jerusalem, every one with his staff in his hand, for multitude of days; and the streets of the city shall be filled with boys and girls playing in her streets. Thus saith the Lord Almighty, If this shall appear impossible in the view of the remnant of this people in these days; shall it also be impossible in my view, saith the Lord Almighty? Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Behold I will save my people from the land of the east and from the land of the west. And I will gather them and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people and I will be their God in truth and in righteousness.

Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Let your hands be strong, ye who in these days hear these words from the mouth of the prophets, from the day the foundation of the house of the Lord Almighty was laid and during the time the temple hath been a
10 building. For before those days, the earnings of the men could be of no avail, and the earnings of the cattle could not be lasting; nor could there be any security from affliction to him who went out or to him who came in. For I set all the men every one against his neighbour. But I will not now deal with the remnant of this people, as in the former days, saith the Lord Almighty: but will shew peace. Their vine shall yield its fruit. And the earth shall yield its products; and the heaven shall shed its dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. And it shall come to pass, that as you, the house of Juda and the house of Israel, were for a curse among the nations; so I will save you, and you shall be for a blessing.

14 Be of good courage and let your hands be strong, for thus saith the Lord Almighty, In the same manner as I thought of afflicting you, when your fathers provoked me, saith the Lord Almighty and I relented not; so I have determined and have my mind bent, in these days, on prospering Jerusalem and the house of Juda. Be of good courage. These are the things which ye shall do—Speak truth every one to his neighbour; administer the judgment of truth and peace in your gates; and devise not evil in your hearts every one against his neighbour; and love not a false oath: for all these things I hate, saith the Lord Almighty.

18 Then a word of the Lord Almighty came to me, saying, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, The fourth fast, and the fifth fast, and the seventh fast, and the tenth fast shall be to the house of Juda for joy and gladness and for cheerful festivals, and ye shall rejoice. Therefore love truth and peace. Thus saith the Lord Almighty, There shall yet come many peoples; and the inhabitants of many cities—even the inhabitants of five cities shall come together to one city, saying, Let us go to pray before the Lord and to seek the face of the Lord Almighty. I am going. So many peoples and many nations will come to seek the face of the Lord Almighty at Jerusalem, and to conciliate the favour of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord Almighty, If in those days ten men of all the tongues of the nations take hold, they must take hold of the skirt of a Jew, saying, We will go with thee, for we have heard that God is with you.
IX. IV. *A BURDEN of the word of the Lord.

In the land of Sedrach and Damascus is his sacrifice, because the Lord hath an eye over men, particularly over all the tribes of Israel: in Hemath also—in the borders thereof.

2 As for Tyre and Sidon, because they were very prudent,
3 therefore Tyre built for herself bulwarks, and treasured up silver like dust, and collected gold like dirt in the highways; but on account of this the Lord will take possession of them, and he will smite her power into the sea; and she shall be consumed by fire. Ascalon shall see and be terrified; so shall Gaza, and be exceedingly pained: Akkaron also; because at her fall she was confounded. And a king shall perish out of Gaza; and Ascalon shall no more be inhabited. And strangers shall dwell in Azotus. And I will destroy the pride of the Philistines, and take away their blood out of their mouths, and their abominations from between their teeth. But they themselves shall be left for our God and shall be like a captain of a thousand in Juda; and Akkaron shall be like a Jebusite. And I will station for my house a guard not to be passed nor repassed. And the plunderer shall no more come against them; for now I have seen with mine own eyes.

9 Rejoice exceedingly, O daughter of Sion! Make proclamation, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold thy king is coming for thee. He is righteous and a saviour. He is meek and mounted on an ass, even a young colt. He will destroy chariots out of Ephraim and horses out of Jerusalem: and the battle bow shall be destroyed. And there shall be a multitude and peace from the nations; and he shall rule over waters to the sea, and over rivers to the ends of the earth. As for thee, thou by the blood of thy covenant hast sent forth thy prisoners out of a pit which hath no water. You the prisoners of the congregation shall be placed in strong holds, and for thy one day's sojourning I will make thee twofold compensation. For I have bent thee Juda; a bow for myself and filled it with Ephraim; and I will raise up thy sons, O Sion, against the sons of Greece, and I will handle thee as the sword of a warrior. Let but the Lord be against them and he will dart out like a thunderbolt. The Lord Almighty will sound a trumpet, and march in the bil-

* See the note at the close of this volume.
15 low of his threat. The Lord Almighty will protect them, and they shall consume them and overwhelm them with sling stones;
16 and drink them up as wine and fill the phials as an altar. In that day the Lord their God will save them—his people like a flock.
    Because holy stones are rolled on his land.—
17    Because if there be any thing good it is his, if any thing comely it is his; with regard to corn for the youths, and flax-
X.    ourous wine for virgins, ask ye of the Lord, rain in its season, the former and latter rain. The Lord hath made appearances, and he will give rain in plenty—to every one herb-
2 age in his field. Because the prophesiers spoke of labours, and the diviners told false visions and lying dreams—gave false comfort, therefore they were dried up. Like sheep they
3 were afflicted. Because there was no healing; against the shepherds my wrath is kindled; but over the lambs I will keep a strict watch. The Lord God Almighty will indeed watch over his flock, the house of Juda, and he will array them as
4 his comely horse in battle. When from him he hath looked, and from him drawn up in array; then from him shall issue forth the wrathful bow, from him every one who sallieth out
5 at the same time. And they shall be like warriors trampling dirt in the highways, and shall be drawn up in array for battle. Because the Lord is with them, therefore the riders on
6 horses shall be put to shame. And I will strengthen the house of Juda, and save the house of Joseph, and settle them in their houses, because I have loved them: and they shall be as if I had not cast them off; for I am the Lord their God and I
7 will hearken to them: and they shall be like the warriors of Ephraim; and their heart shall be gladdened as with wine; and their children shall see and be made glad; and their heart shall
8 rejoice in the Lord. I will make a signal for them and receive them, for I will redeem them and they shall multiply as they
9 have done. Though I sow them among peoples, yet they who are far off will remember me. They shall nurture up their
10 children and return: and I will bring them back out of the land of Egypt; and gather them from amongst the Assyrians; and bring them to Galaaditis and Lebanon and not
11 one of them shall be left behind. And they shall cross over a narrow sea and lash waves at sea; and all the depths of rivers
shall be dried up, and all the haughtiness of the Assyrians shall be removed; and the sceptre of Egypt shall be taken quite away. And I will strengthen them in the Lord their God, and in his name they shall boast; saith the Lord.

XI. Open thy gates, O Libanus and let a fire devour thy cedars. Raise the mournful cry, O pine tree, since the cedar is fallen, because the mighty are in great distress. Howl ye oaks of Basan, because the thick planted forest is rooted up. A sound of shepherds singing the song of woe, because their greatness is involved in distress; a sound of lions roaring, because the swelling of the Jordan hath distressed them.

Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, you are feeding the flock prepared for slaughter, which the possessors were slaughtering, and spared not; and they who sold them said, "Blessed be the Lord for we are enriched," and their shepherds had no feeling for them. Therefore I will no more spare the inhabitants of this land, saith the Lord. Now behold I deliver up the men, every one into the hand of his neighbour, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and I will not deliver out of their hand. Again I will feed the flock of the slaughter for Chananitis; and I will take me two staves, one I had called Beauty, and the other I called Portion; and I will feed the flock, and remove three shepherds in one month; and my soul will be weighed down against them.

For as their souls roared against me, therefore I said, I will not feed you, What is dying let it die; and what is fainting let it faint. And as for the rest, let them devour every one the flesh of his neighbour. And I will take my staff Beauty and throw it away, that I may break my covenant which I made with all these tribes. And on that day it shall be broken; and the Chananites, the sheep that are kept for me, shall know for what cause there is a word of the Lord. Then I will say to them, If it seemeth good in your sight, give me my wages; if not, forbear. And when they had weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver; then the Lord said to me, Put them in the smelting furnace, and let me see whether it be proof: as I have been proved for them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them down in the house of the Lord, for the smelting furnace. Then I threw away the other
staff Portion, that I may break the jointenancy between Juda and Israel.

15 Then the Lord said to me, Take thee yet the pastoral utensils of an unskilful shepherd; for behold I am about to raise up a shepherd against this land, who will not visit what is fainting, nor seek what is scattered; nor heal what is bruised; nor lead aright what is sound; but will devour the flesh of the choice, and tear their joints asunder. O ye feeders of vanities who have forsaken the sheep. There is a sword against his arms, and against his right eye. Shall his arm be quite withered, and his right eye utterly put out?

XII. V. THE burden of the word of the Lord against Israel. The Lord who stretcheth out the heaven and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him, saith, Behold I will make Jerusalem like shaken porches for all the peoples around. And by Judea there shall be a siege against Jerusalem, and in that day I will make Jerusalem a stone to be trampled by all the nations: every one who trampleth her will make her his mocking stock. When all the nations of the earth shall be gathered against her, in that day saith the Lord Almighty, I will smite every horse with astonishment and his rider with madness. But upon the house of Juda I will open mine eyes. When I smite all the horses of the peoples with blindness, then will Juda’s captains of thousands say in their hearts, “We shall find those for us who inhabit Jerusalem by the Lord Almighty their God.” In that day I will make Juda’s captains of thousands like a firebrand among wood, and like a flaming torch among stubble. And they shall devour on the right and on the left all the peoples around. And Jerusalem shall again dwell by herself in Jerusalem. And the Lord will save the dwellings of Juda as at the beginning.

That the boasting of the house of David may not be magnified, nor the elevation of the inhabitants of Jerusalem depend upon Juda, The Lord will indeed, in that day, spread a shield over the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the weak among them shall in that day be like David, and the house of David like the house of God—like an angel of the Lord before them. And it shall come to pass, in that day, that I will seek to destroy all
10 the nations that come against Jerusalem. And when I pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and compassion, then will they look to him whom they pierced, and they will mourn for him with a mourning as for a beloved; and be afflicted with sorrow as for a first born. In that day the weeping in Jerusalem will be great, like the weeping of a pomegranate grove cut down in the plain.

12 And the land will mourn in separate families, the family of the house of David by itself and their women by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their women by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their women by themselves; the family of Symeon by itself and their women by themselves; all the remaining families, every family by itself and their women by themselves. In that day every place will be opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for the removal and for the separation.

2 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land; and there shall no more be a remembrance of them. And I will remove the false prophets and the unclean spirit out of the land.

3 And it shall come to pass that if any man shall still prophesy, even his father and his mother who begot him will say to him, Thou shalt not live, because thou hast spoken lies in the name of the Lord. And his father and his mother who begot him will bind him when he prophesieth. And in that day the prophets shall be exposed to shame; every one for his vision, when he prophesieth: and they shall be clothed with a hairy skin because they lied. And when one will say, I am not a prophet, for from my youth I am a husbandman, because a husbandman begot me; then I will say to him, what wounds are these in thy hands? And he will say, those with which I was wounded in my beloved house.

7 Awake, O sword, against my shepherds, and against my chief citizen, saith the Lord Almighty; I will smite the shepherds and the sheep shall be scattered and I will bring my hand on the little ones. And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts of it shall be cut off and die and the third part shall be left in it. And when I have passed this third part through fire, and tried them as silver is tried, and
proved them as gold is proved; this people will invoke my name and I will hear them and say, this is my people, and they will say, the Lord is my God.

XIV. Behold days of the Lord are coming, when thy spoils shall be divided in thee. I will indeed gather all the nations against Jerusalem for battle, and the city shall be taken and the houses rifled and the women polluted. And the half of the city shall go forth into captivity. As for the remainder of my people they shall not be utterly cut off. From this city, the Lord indeed will come forth and draw up in array among the nations, as in the day of his array in the day of battle; and on that day his feet will stand on the mount of olives over against Jerusalem on the east side and the mount of olives shall be cleft, east and west, a very great chasm. And the half of the mount will lean to the north and the half of it to the south. And the valley of my mountains shall be blocked up; and the valley of mountains shall be closed up even to Jasod. It shall be blocked up as it was in the days of the earthquake—in the days of Ozias king of Juda. And when the Lord my God shall come and all the holy ones with him, it shall come to pass that on that day there shall not be light; there shall be chiliness and cold during one day. That will indeed be a memorable day to the Lord. It will neither be day nor night; but towards evening there will be light. And on that day living water will flow out of Jerusalem; the one half of it to the eastern sea and the one half of it to the western sea, both in summer and spring it shall be so. And the Lord will be king over all the earth. In that day there will be one Lord and his name one, enclosing for Jerusalem all the land and the desert around, from Gabea to Remmon southward. As for Rama, it shall continue in its place. From the gate of Benjamin to the place of the first gate, on to the gate of the corners and to the tower of Anameel, on to the king's wine presses there shall be dwellers in it and there shall no more be a curse and in the inhabitance of Jerusalem they shall be secure. And this shall be the plague with which the Lord will smite all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem—their flesh shall waste away while they stand on their feet; and their eyes shall melt from their sockets, and their tongue shall rot in their mouth. And in that day there shall be a great dread of the Lord upon them. And they
will lay hold, every one, on the hand of his neighbour and his hand will be grasped in his neighbour's hand. And Juda will draw up in array in Jerusalem and collect the wealth of all the peoples around—gold and silver and raiment in great abundance. And the plague of the horses and the mules and the camels and the asses—that of all the cattle in those camps shall be the same as this plague. And it shall come to pass that all who are left of the nations which came against Jerusalem shall come up every year to worship the Lord Almighty and to celebrate the festival of tabernacles. And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall not come up to Jerusalem from all the tribes of this land, to worship the king, the Lord Almighty, even they shall be added to those. But if the tribe of Egypt go not up nor come; upon them shall be the plague with which the Lord will smite all the nations which come not up to celebrate the festival of tabernacles. This shall be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations which decline to come up to celebrate the festival of tabernacles.

In that day there shall be on the bridle of the horse, "Holy to the Lord Almighty." And the kettles in the house of the Lord shall be like the bowls before the altar. And every kettle in Jerusalem and in Juda shall be holy to the Lord Almighty. And all that sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there shall no more be a Chananite in the house of the Lord Almighty in that day.

MALACHI,

I. The charge of the word of the Lord to Israel by the ministry of his messenger. Lay it up in your hearts I beseech you.

I have loved you, saith the Lord. But you said, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau the brother of Jacob? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob and slighted Esau and made his borders a waste, and the houses of a desert his inheritance.

For should he say, "Idumea is overthrown, let us return and build up the waste cities." Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Let them build, but I will overturn. They shall indeed be surnamed, "The borders of iniquity" and "A people to whom the Lord hath ever been opposed." And your eyes shall
see and you will say, "The Lord is magnified far beyond the borders of Israel."

6 A son honoureth a father; and a servant, his master. Now if I be a father, where is my honour? And if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the Lord Almighty.

As for you priests, you are they who bring dishonour on my name. Do you say, By what have we brought dishonour on thy name? By offering on mine altar polluted loaves. And do you say, How have we polluted them? When you said,

7 The table of the Lord is polluted, you then caused no regard to be paid to that which was to be laid thereon. Since, if you offer the blind for sacrifices, it is not evil; and if you offer the lame or sickly, it is not evil. Offer such now to thy governor, will he admit thee? Will he accept thy person? saith the Lord Almighty. Now then do you conciliate the favour of your God when you supplicate him? When such [offerings] are made by your hands, shall I for your sakes accept your persons? saith the Lord Almighty. Since by you the doors will be shut, and a fire will not be kindled on mine altar for nothing, I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord Almighty; nor will I accept

10 a sacrifice at your hands. Since from the risings of the sun to its goings down my name hath been glorified among the nations; and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure sacrifice—since my name is great among the nations, saith the Lord Almighty, and you profane it, by your saying,

13 "The table of the Lord is polluted," and when no regard was paid to the offerings laid thereon—his meats, you said, "These are because of affliction," and though I rejected them, saith the Lord Almighty, yet you offered the torn, the lame and the sickly; if then you bring this sacrifice shall I accept such at your hands, saith the Lord Almighty, when he is cursed, who is of ability and who hath a male in his flock and his vow upon him, and sacrificeth to the Lord a corrupted thing?

Because I am a great king, saith the Lord Almighty and my name is illustrious among the nations, now therefore

II. this command is for you, O priests. If you will not hearken and if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name, saith the Lord Almighty, I will send that curse against you and curse your blessing. I will curse it; and disperse your blessing
and it shall not be among you because you do not lay this to heart. Behold I set apart for you the shoulder, now I will scatter the great intestine on your faces—the great intestine of your festivals and take you to it. Now you must know, since I sent this command to you to be my covenant with the Levites, saith the Lord Almighty, that my covenant of life and peace was with him; and I gave it to him that I might be greatly feared and that he might be awed at my name. The law of truth was in his mouth; and iniquity should not have been found in his lips. Walking uprightly with me in peace, he indeed turned many from iniquity. Because the lips of a priest were to keep knowledge therefore law was to be sought from his mouth; since he is a messenger of the Lord Almighty: but as for you, you have turned aside out of the way and weakened many by law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord Almighty, therefore I have made you contemptible and outcasts among all the nations, because you did not keep my ways, but in law have had respect to persons.

Have you not all one father? Hath not one God created you? Why then have you forsaken every one his brother? For profaning the covenant of your fathers, Juda was forsaken. There was indeed abomination in Israel and in Jerusalem, because Juda profaned the holy things of the Lord in which he delighted and studiously went after strange gods. The Lord will cut off the man who doth such things until he be humbled from the dwellings of Jacob and from among them who offer a sacrifice to the Lord Almighty.

Moreover you have done those things which I hate. You have covered the altar of the Lord with tears. And amidst lamentations and groans for oppression is it still proper to look upon a sacrifice, or receive it acceptably at your hands? And do you say, Why not? Because God was a witness between thee and the wife of thy youth whom thou hast forsaken, though she was thy companion and the wife of thy covenant. Now did not he who had the residue of spirit, do right? Yet you have said, "What else but a seed doth God require?" But keep this in your mind, "Thou must not forsake the wife of thy youth."

(a) "But if thou having hated shalt put away—saith the Lord God of Israel."
(b) And will impiety, saith the Lord Almighty put a cloak over thy lusts? Therefore keep this in your mind, "You must not forsake."

17 You have provoked God with your sayings. And do you ask, By what have we provoked him? By your saying, "Every one doing evil doth that which is good in the sight of the Lord." Now were he well pleased with such; where then is the God of Righteousness?

III. Behold I am about to send my messenger and he will examine the way before me. And the Lord whom ye seek—even the angel of the covenant whom you desire will come suddenly to his temple. Behold he is coming, saith the Lord Almighty. And who can abide the day of his coming? Or who can stand his appearance? Since he is coming like the fire of a refiner's furnace; and like the soap of the fullers. He will sit refining and purifying and will purify the sons of Levi like the silver and gold, and melt them like the gold and silver.

4 Then shall they offer to the Lord a sacrifice in righteousness and the sacrifice of Juda and Jerusalem will please the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years. And I will bring to judgment before you and be a swift witness against sorcerers, and against adulteresses, and against them who swear by my name to a falsehood, and against them who deprive the hireling of his wages, and them who oppress the widow, and them who buffet the fatherless, and them who turn aside the cause of the stranger, and them who do not fear me, saith the Lord Almighty. Because I the Lord am your God and change not; but you the sons of Jacob do not abstain from the iniquities of your fathers—you have turned aside my statutes and have not kept them: turn to me and I will turn to you, saith the Lord Almighty. Do you say, Wherein shall we turn?

8 Will a man supplant God? For you supplant me: and will you say, wherein have we supplanted thee? Because the tythes and the first fruits are with you, and you view them again and again and supplant me.

10 The year is ended and you have carried the products into

(a) The objection. (b) The answer.
your stores. Now let that which hath been plundered from him be in his house. Turn now in this respect, saith the Lord Almighty: (see) if I will not open for you the flood gates of heaven and pour my blessing upon you, until there is enough; and send you it for food and no more destroy the fruit of your land; so that your vine shall no more be sickly in the field, saith the Lord Almighty, and all the nations will hail you happy: for you will be a beloved land, saith the Lord Almighty.

You have brought heavy accusations against me, saith the Lord.

Do you say, in what instance have we spoken against thee?

You say, "Vain is he who serveth God: and what advantage is it, that we have kept his charges. For though we have walked as supplicants before the Lord Almighty, yet we now call strangers happy; and all that do unlawful things are built up. Though they opposed God; yet they are saved."

Against these things they who feared the Lord spoke to one another; and the Lord hearkened and heard and wrote a book of remembrance before him for them who fear the Lord and revere his name.

And they shall be, saith the Lord Almighty, an acquisition for me, on the day which I make; and I will make choice of them, as a man maketh choice of a son who serveth him. And when you shall be converted, you shall see the difference between a righteous man and one who is unrighteous; and between him who serveth God and him who serveth not. For behold a day is coming, heated like an oven, which shall set them on fire. And all aliens and all workers of iniquity shall be like stubble. The day which is coming shall blaze upon them, saith the Lord Almighty, and of them neither root nor branch shall be left. But to you who fear my name the son of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings; and you shall go forth and leap for joy like young bullocks loosed from yokes.

And you shall trample down the wicked, for they will be like ashes under your feet, on the day which I make, saith the Lord Almighty.

Now behold I will send you Elias the Thesbite before that great and awful day of the Lord cometh; who will turn the heart of father to son and the heart of one man to another
that I may not come and smite the land with utter destruction.
4 Remember the law of Moses my servant, as I gave him in charge at Choreb statutes and rules of rectitude for all Israel.

END OF THE OLD COVENANT.

NOTE.

Zacharias IX. I. A Burden.] This, and the five following Chapters, though added to what Zacharias wrote, appear evidently, from the style and subjects, to be the work of another. The Evangelist Matthew, in his quotation, (Chap. II.) ascribes them to Jeremias. And it must be allowed that the contents of these chapters agree well with the time of Jeremias, but by no means with that of Zacharias. And the same may be said with respect to the style, which corresponds with that of Jeremias, but not in the least with that of Zacharias. From the words of the Evangelist it would appear, that in his time, they were considered as being written by Jeremias:—and it is to be observed that in some ancient manuscripts, there is a large vacant space between the end of Chap. VIII. and IX. to distinguish what precedes, from that which follows.
ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.

THE words printed in italics in this Translation, are not added by the Translator, as in our common version; but are thus designated, as being emphatical. Such as have been added, are included in [   ].

Names of Persons and Places mentioned in the Old Testament are spelled as in the Septuagint; and in the position of chapters, and parts of chapters, the order observed in that version, has, in general, been strictly attended to: there are, however, a very few deviations from this rule, which the sense and connection seemed to require; but the numbers annexed to such chapters and verses will point out their relative situation in the Greek: an instance of this kind occurs in Job, XL. and XLII. and in the position and arrangement of the chapters or discourses of Jeremias, from chapter XX. to XLVI.

The numbers of the chapters and verses, (so far as it was thought necessary to retain them) are inserted for the sake of those who may wish to compare this Translation with that in common use.

The following Errata have been observed, which the reader is requested to correct with his pen:
